- GHSA-q5wr-xfw9-q7xr

details: In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame
  payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious
  client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual
  settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%.
  nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability.
  Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS
  frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.
