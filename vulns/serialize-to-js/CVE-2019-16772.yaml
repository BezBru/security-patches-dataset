details: The serialize-to-js NPM package before version 3.0.1 is vulnerable to Cross-site
  Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized
  regular expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since
  Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward
  slashes in regular expressions. If serialized data of regular expression objects
  are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability.
