details: "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through\
  \ 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1.\
  \ NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an\
  \ inaccurate bug scope and patch links. \u201C1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue\
  \ scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself.\
  \ In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway.\
  \ As such, the description stating \u2018An issue was discovered in docker-kong\
  \ (for Kong) through 2.0.3.\u2019 is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user\
  \ decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation.\
  \ The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong,\
  \ and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE\
  \ currently points to a documentation improvement as a \u201CPatch\u201D link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This\
  \ link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However,\
  \ instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here:\
  \ https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions\
  \ , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949)\
  \ Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo\
  \ to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information\
  \ on this topic.\u201D"
