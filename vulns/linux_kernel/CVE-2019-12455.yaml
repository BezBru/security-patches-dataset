details: "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup in drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c\
  \ in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name,\
  \ which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference\
  \ and system crash). NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because \u201C\
  The memory allocation that was not checked is part of a code that only runs at boot\
  \ time, before user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for\
  \ an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of service.\u201D."
