details: A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernel module,
  where a user with a local account and the ability to read the /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add
  file can create ZRAM device nodes in the /dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel
  memory and is not accounted for a user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device.
  With this vulnerability, continually reading the device may consume a large amount
  of system memory and cause the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer to activate and terminate
  random userspace processes, possibly making the system inoperable.
