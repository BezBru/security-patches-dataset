details: In the Linux kernel before 5.3.11, sound/core/timer.c has a use-after-free
  caused by erroneous code refactoring, aka CID-e7af6307a8a5. This is related to snd_timer_open
  and snd_timer_close_locked. The timeri variable was originally intended to be for
  a newly created timer instance, but was used for a different purpose after refactoring.
