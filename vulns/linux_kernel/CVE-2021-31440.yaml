details: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected
  installations of Linux Kernel 5.11.15. An attacker must first obtain the ability
  to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
  The specific flaw exists within the handling of eBPF programs. The issue results
  from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing
  them. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute
  arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-13661.
