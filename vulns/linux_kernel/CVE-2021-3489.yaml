details: 'The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel did
  not check that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf size, allowing an
  attacker to perform out-of-bounds writes within the kernel and therefore, arbitrary
  code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 4b81ccebaeee ("bpf, ringbuf: Deny
  reserve of buffers larger than ringbuf") (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable
  kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced via 457f44363a88 ("bpf:
  Implement BPF ring buffer and verifier support for it") (v5.8-rc1).'
