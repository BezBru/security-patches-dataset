details: "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s implementation of MIDI, where\
  \ an attacker with a local account and the permissions to issue ioctl commands to\
  \ midi devices could trigger a use-after-free issue. A write to this specific memory\
  \ while freed and before use causes the flow of execution to change and possibly\
  \ allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this\
  \ vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
