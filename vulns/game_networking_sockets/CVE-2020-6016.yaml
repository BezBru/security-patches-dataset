details: Valve's Game Networking Sockets prior to version v1.2.0 improperly handles
  unreliable segments with negative offsets in function SNP_ReceiveUnreliableSegment(),
  leading to a Heap-Based Buffer Underflow and a free() of memory not from the heap,
  resulting in a memory corruption and probably even a remote code execution.
