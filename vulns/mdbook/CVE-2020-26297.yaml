details: mdBook is a utility to create modern online books from Markdown files and
  is written in Rust. In mdBook before version 0.4.5, there is a vulnerability affecting
  the search feature of mdBook, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
  JavaScript code on the page. The search feature of mdBook (introduced in version
  0.1.4) was affected by a cross site scripting vulnerability that allowed an attacker
  to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on an user's browser by tricking the user into
  typing a malicious search query, or tricking the user into clicking a link to the
  search page with the malicious search query prefilled. mdBook 0.4.5 fixes the vulnerability
  by properly escaping the search query. Owners of websites built with mdBook have
  to upgrade to mdBook 0.4.5 or greater and rebuild their website contents with it.
