details: lfs/backup in IPFire 2.25-core155 does not ensure that /var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl
  is owned by the root account. It might be owned by an unprivileged account, which
  could potentially be used to install a Trojan horse backup.pl script that is later
  executed by root. Similar problems with the ownership/permissions of other files
  may be present as well.
