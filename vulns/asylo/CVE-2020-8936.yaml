details: An arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerability in Asylo versions up to 0.6.0
  allows an attacker to make a host call to UntrustedCall. UntrustedCall failed to
  validate the buffer range within sgx_params and allowed the host to return a pointer
  that was an address within the enclave memory. This allowed an attacker to read
  memory values from within the enclave.
