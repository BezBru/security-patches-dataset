details: A buffer length validation vulnerability in Asylo versions prior to 0.6.0
  allows an attacker to read data they should not have access to. The 'enc_untrusted_recvfrom'
  function generates a return value which is deserialized by 'MessageReader', and
  copied into three different 'extents'. The length of the third 'extents' is controlled
  by the outside world, and not verified on copy, allowing the attacker to force Asylo
  to copy trusted memory data into an untrusted buffer of significantly small length..
  We recommend updating Asylo to version 0.6.0 or later.
