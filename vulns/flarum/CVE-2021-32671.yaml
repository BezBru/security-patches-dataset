details: Flarum is a forum software for building communities. Flarum's translation
  system allowed for string inputs to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when rendered.
  This change was made after v0.1.0-beta.16 (our last beta before v1.0.0) and was
  not noticed or documented. This allowed for any user to type malicious HTML markup
  within certain user input fields and have this execute on client browsers. The example
  which led to the discovery of this vulnerability was in the forum search box. Entering
  faux-malicious HTML markup, such as <script>alert('test')</script> resulted in an
  alert box appearing on the forum. This attack could also be modified to perform
  AJAX requests on behalf of a user, possibly deleting discussions, modifying their
  settings or profile, or even modifying settings on the Admin panel if the attack
  was targetted towards a privileged user. All Flarum communities that run flarum
  v1.0.0 or v1.0.1 are impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as
  flarum/core v1.0.2. All communities running Flarum v1.0 have to upgrade as soon
  as possible to v1.0.2.
