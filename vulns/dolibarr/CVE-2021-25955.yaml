details: "In \u201CDolibarr ERP CRM\u201D, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2\
  \ are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application\
  \ users to store malicious scripts in the \u201CPrivate Note\u201D field at \u201C\
  /adherents/note.php?id=1\u201D endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019\
  s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst\
  \ case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged\
  \ administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead\
  \ to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper\
  \ Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private\
  \ notes which could lead to privilege escalation."
