details: An issue was discovered in Suricata 5.0.0. It was possible to bypass/evade
  any tcp based signature by faking a closed TCP session using an evil server. After
  the TCP SYN packet, it is possible to inject a RST ACK and a FIN ACK packet with
  a bad TCP Timestamp option. The client will ignore the RST ACK and the FIN ACK packets
  because of the bad TCP Timestamp option. Both linux and windows client are ignoring
  the injected packets.
