details: An issue was discovered in Suricata before 6.0.4. It is possible to bypass/evade
  any HTTP-based signature by faking an RST TCP packet with random TCP options of
  the md5header from the client side. After the three-way handshake, it's possible
  to inject an RST ACK with a random TCP md5header option. Then, the client can send
  an HTTP GET request with a forbidden URL. The server will ignore the RST ACK and
  send the response HTTP packet for the client's request. These packets will not trigger
  a Suricata reject action.
