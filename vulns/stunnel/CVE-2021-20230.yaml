details: A flaw was found in stunnel before 5.57, where it improperly validates client
  certificates when it is configured to use both redirect and verifyChain options.
  This flaw allows an attacker with a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority,
  which is not the one accepted by the stunnel server, to access the tunneled service
  instead of being redirected to the address specified in the redirect option. The
  highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
