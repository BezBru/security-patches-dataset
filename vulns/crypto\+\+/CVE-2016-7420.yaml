details: Crypto++ (aka cryptopp) through 5.6.4 does not document the requirement for
  a compile-time NDEBUG definition disabling the many assert calls that are unintended
  in production use, which might allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive
  information by leveraging access to process memory after an assertion failure, as
  demonstrated by reading a core dump.
