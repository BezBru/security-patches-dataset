details: The Boxstarter installer before version 2.13.0 configures C:\ProgramData\Boxstarter
  to be in the system-wide PATH environment variable. However, this directory is writable
  by normal, unprivileged users. To exploit the vulnerability, place a DLL in this
  directory that a privileged service is looking for. For example, WptsExtensions.dll
  When Windows starts, it'll execute the code in DllMain() with SYSTEM privileges.
  Any unprivileged user can execute code with SYSTEM privileges. The issue is fixed
  in version 3.13.0
