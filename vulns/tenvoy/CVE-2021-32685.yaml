details: 'tEnvoy contains the PGP, NaCl, and PBKDF2 in node.js and the browser (hashing,
  random, encryption, decryption, signatures, conversions), used by TogaTech.org.
  In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey`
  always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512
  hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in
  version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method
  definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement
  call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.'
