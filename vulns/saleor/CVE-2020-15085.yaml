details: In Saleor Storefront before version 2.10.3, request data used to authenticate
  customers was inadvertently cached in the browser's local storage mechanism, including
  credentials. A malicious user with direct access to the browser could extract the
  email and password. In versions prior to 2.10.0 persisted the cache even after the
  user logged out. This is fixed in version 2.10.3. A workaround is to manually clear
  application data (browser's local storage) after logging into Saleor Storefront.
