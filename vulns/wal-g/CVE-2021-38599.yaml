details: WAL-G before 1.1, when a non-libsodium build (e.g., one of the official binary
  releases published as GitHub Releases) is used, silently ignores the libsodium encryption
  key and uploads cleartext backups. This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise
  violation because "the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity."
