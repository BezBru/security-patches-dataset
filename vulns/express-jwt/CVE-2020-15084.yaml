details: 'In express-jwt (NPM package) up and including version 5.3.3, the algorithms
  entry to be specified in the configuration is not being enforced. When algorithms
  is not specified in the configuration, with the combination of jwks-rsa, it may
  lead to authorization bypass. You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the
  following conditions apply: - You are using express-jwt - You do not have **algorithms**
  configured in your express-jwt configuration. - You are using libraries such as
  jwks-rsa as the **secret**. You can fix this by specifying **algorithms** in the

  6.0.0.'
