details: In ACCEL-PPP (an implementation of PPTP/PPPoE/L2TP/SSTP), there is a buffer
  overflow when receiving an l2tp control packet ith an AVP which type is a string
  and no hidden flags, length set to less than 6. If your application is used in open
  networks or there are untrusted nodes in the network it is highly recommended to
  apply the patch. The problem was patched with commit 2324bcd5ba12cf28f47357a8f03cd41b7c04c52b
  As a workaround changes of commit 2324bcd5ba12cf28f47357a8f03cd41b7c04c52b can be
  applied to older versions.
