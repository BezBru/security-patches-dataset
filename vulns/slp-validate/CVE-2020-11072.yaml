details: In SLP Validate (npm package slp-validate) before version 1.2.1, users could
  experience false-negative validation outcomes for MINT transaction operations. A
  poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow spending of the affected tokens which
  would result in the destruction of a user's minting baton. This has been fixed in
  slp-validate in version 1.2.1. Additonally, slpjs version 0.27.2 has a related fix
  under related CVE-2020-11071.
