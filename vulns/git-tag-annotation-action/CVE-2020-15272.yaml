details: In the git-tag-annotation-action (open source GitHub Action) before version
  1.0.1, an attacker can execute arbitrary (*) shell commands if they can control
  the value of [the `tag` input] or manage to alter the value of [the `GITHUB_REF`
  environment variable]. The problem has been patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't
  use the `tag` input you are most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable
  is protected by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible.
  If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `> 1.0.0` make sure that the
  value is not controlled by another Action.
