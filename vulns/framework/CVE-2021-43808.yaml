details: Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0,
  7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user
  taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being
  able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections.
  If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability
  can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6,
  and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random
  hash that is unique to each request.
