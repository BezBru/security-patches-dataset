details: xmldom is a pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) DOMParser
  and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.4.0 and older do not correctly preserve
  system identifiers, FPIs or namespaces when repeatedly parsing and serializing maliciously
  crafted documents. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing
  in some downstream applications. This is fixed in version 0.5.0. As a workaround
  downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted
  documents.
