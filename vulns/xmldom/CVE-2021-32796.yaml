details: xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level
  2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older do not
  correctly escape special characters when serializing elements removed from their
  ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in
  some downstream applications. This issue has been resolved in version 0.7.0. As
  a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously
  crafted documents.
