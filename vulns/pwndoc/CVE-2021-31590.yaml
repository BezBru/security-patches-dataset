aliases: []
modified: 2021-12-03T13:52Z
published: 2021-07-19T20:15Z
details: PwnDoc all versions until 0.4.0 (2021-08-23) has incorrect JSON Webtoken
  handling, leading to incorrect access control. With a valid JSON Webtoken that is
  used for authentication and authorization, a user can keep his admin privileges
  even if he is downgraded to the "user" privilege. Even after a user's account is
  deleted, the user can still access the administration panel (and add or delete users)
  and has complete access to the system.
