details: Minio is a Kubernetes native application for cloud storage. All users on
  release `RELEASE.2021-10-10T16-53-30Z` are affected by a vulnerability that involves
  bypassing policy restrictions on regular users. Normally, checkKeyValid() should
  return owner true for rootCreds. In the affected version, policy restriction did
  not work properly for users who did not have service (svc) or security token service
  (STS) accounts. This issue is fixed in `RELEASE.2021-10-13T00-23-17Z`. A downgrade
  back to release `RELEASE.2021-10-08T23-58-24Z` is available as a workaround.
