details: 'MinIO is an open-source high performance object storage service and it is
  API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z,
  there is a vulnerability which enables MITM modification of request bodies that
  are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using
  aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk.
  This check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater
  than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without
  ever reaching the end of the chunk + thereby without ever checking the chunk signature.
  This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z. As a workaround one can avoid
  using "aws-chunked" encoding-based chunk signature upload requests instead use TLS.
  MinIO SDKs automatically disable chunked encoding signature when the server endpoint
  is configured with TLS.'
