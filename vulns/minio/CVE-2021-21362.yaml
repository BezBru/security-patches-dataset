details: 'MinIO is an open-source high performance object storage service and it is
  API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z
  it is possible to bypass a readOnly policy by creating a temporary ''mc share upload''
  URL. Everyone is impacted who uses MinIO multi-users. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z.
  As a workaround, one can disable uploads with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
  as mentioned in the S3 API RESTObjectPOST docs by using a proxy in front of MinIO.'
