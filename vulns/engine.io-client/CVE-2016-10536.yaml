details: engine.io-client is the client for engine.io, the implementation of a transport-based
  cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. The
  vulnerability is related to the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized`
  setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, certificate verification
  will be disabled. This is problematic as engine.io-client 1.6.8 and earlier passes
  in an object for settings that includes the rejectUnauthorized property, whether
  it has been set or not. If the value has not been explicitly changed, it will be
  passed in as `null`, resulting in certificate verification being turned off.
