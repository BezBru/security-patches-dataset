details: In libvips before 8.6.3, a NULL function pointer dereference vulnerability
  was found in the vips_region_generate function in region.c, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact
  via a crafted image file. This occurs because of a race condition involving a failed
  delayed load and other worker threads.
