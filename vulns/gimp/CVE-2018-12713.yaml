details: GIMP through 2.10.2 makes g_get_tmp_dir calls to establish temporary filenames,
  which may result in a filename that already exists, as demonstrated by the gimp_write_and_read_file
  function in app/tests/test-xcf.c. This might be leveraged by attackers to overwrite
  files or read file content that was intended to be private.
