details: This affects the package total.js before 3.4.7. The issue occurs in the image.pipe
  and image.stream functions. The type parameter is used to build the command that
  is then executed using child_process.spawn. The issue occurs because child_process.spawn
  is called with the option shell set to true and because the type parameter is not
  properly sanitized.
