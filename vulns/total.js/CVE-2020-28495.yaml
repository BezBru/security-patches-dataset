details: This affects the package total.js before 3.4.7. The set function can be used
  to set a value into the object according to the path. However the keys of the path
  being set are not properly sanitized, leading to a prototype pollution vulnerability.
  The impact depends on the application. In some cases it is possible to achieve Denial
  of service (DoS), Remote Code Execution or Property Injection.
