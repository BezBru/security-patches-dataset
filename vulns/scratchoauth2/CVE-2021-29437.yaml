details: ScratchOAuth2 is an Oauth implementation for Scratch. Any ScratchOAuth2-related
  data normally accessible and modifiable by a user can be read and modified by a
  third party. 1. Scratch user visits 3rd party site. 2. 3rd party site asks user
  for Scratch username. 3. 3rd party site pretends to be user and gets login code
  from ScratchOAuth2. 4. 3rd party site gives code to user and instructs them to post
  it on their profile. 5. User posts code on their profile, not knowing it is a ScratchOAuth2
  login code. 6. 3rd party site completes login with ScratchOAuth2. 7. 3rd party site
  has full access to anything the user could do if they directly logged in. See referenced
  GitHub security advisory for patch notes and workarounds.
