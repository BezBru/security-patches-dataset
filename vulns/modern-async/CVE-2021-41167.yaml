details: 'modern-async is an open source JavaScript tooling library for asynchronous
  operations using async/await and promises. In affected versions a bug affecting
  two of the functions in this library: forEachSeries and forEachLimit. They should
  limit the concurrency of some actions but, in practice, they don''t. Any code calling
  these functions will be written thinking they would limit the concurrency but they
  won''t. This could lead to potential security issues in other projects. The problem
  has been patched in 1.0.4. There is no workaround.'
