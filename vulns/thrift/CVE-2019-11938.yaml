details: Java Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages declaring
  containers of sizes larger than the payload. As a result, malicious clients could
  send short messages which would result in a large memory allocation, potentially
  leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2019.12.09.00.
