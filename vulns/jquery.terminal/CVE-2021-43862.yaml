details: jQuery Terminal Emulator is a plugin for creating command line interpreters
  in your applications. Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited
  cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible,
  but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the
  application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker
  can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript
  attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror`
  on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the
  user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this
  workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work
  when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code
  in different way).
