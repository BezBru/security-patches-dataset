details: 'remark-html is an open source nodejs library which compiles Markdown to
  HTML. In affected versions the documentation of remark-html has mentioned that it
  was safe by default. In practice the default was never safe and had to be opted
  into. That is, user input was not sanitized. This means arbitrary HTML can be passed
  through leading to potential XSS attacks. The problem has been patched in 13.0.2
  and 14.0.1: `remark-html` is now safe by default, and the implementation matches
  the documentation. On older affected versions, pass `sanitize: true` if you cannot
  update.'
