details: Contour is a Kubernetes ingress controller using Envoy proxy. In Contour
  before version 1.17.1 a specially crafted ExternalName type Service may be used
  to access Envoy's admin interface, which Contour normally prevents from access outside
  the Envoy container. This can be used to shut down Envoy remotely (a denial of service),
  or to expose the existence of any Secret that Envoy is using for its configuration,
  including most notably TLS Keypairs. However, it *cannot* be used to get the *content*
  of those secrets. Since this attack allows access to the administration interface,
  a variety of administration options are available, such as shutting down the Envoy
  or draining traffic. In general, the Envoy admin interface cannot easily be used
  for making changes to the cluster, in-flight requests, or backend services, but
  it could be used to shut down or drain Envoy, change traffic routing, or to retrieve
  secret metadata, as mentioned above. The issue will be addressed in Contour v1.18.0
  and a cherry-picked patch release, v1.17.1, has been released to cover users who
  cannot upgrade at this time. For more details refer to the linked GitHub Security
  Advisory.
