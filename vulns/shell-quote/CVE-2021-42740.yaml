details: The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows command injection.
  An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to
  support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real
  shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary
  commands. This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is {A-z]
  instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space
  between capital letter Z and lower case letter a, such as the backtick character.
