details: Jenkins before versions 2.44, 2.32.2 is vulnerable to an insufficient permission
  check for periodic processes (SECURITY-389). The URLs /workspaceCleanup and /fingerprintCleanup
  did not perform permission checks, allowing users with read access to Jenkins to
  trigger these background processes (that are otherwise performed daily), possibly
  causing additional load on Jenkins master and agents.
