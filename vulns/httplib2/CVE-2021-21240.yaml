details: httplib2 is a comprehensive HTTP client library for Python. In httplib2 before
  version 0.19.0, a malicious server which responds with long series of "\xa0" characters
  in the "www-authenticate" header may cause Denial of Service (CPU burn while parsing
  header) of the httplib2 client accessing said server. This is fixed in version 0.19.0
  which contains a new implementation of auth headers parsing using the pyparsing
  library.
