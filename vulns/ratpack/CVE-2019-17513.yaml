details: An issue was discovered in Ratpack before 1.7.5. Due to a misuse of the Netty
  library class DefaultHttpHeaders, there is no validation that headers lack HTTP
  control characters. Thus, if untrusted data is used to construct HTTP headers with
  Ratpack, HTTP Response Splitting can occur.
