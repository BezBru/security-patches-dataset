details: Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected XSS. The Revive
  Adserver web installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the
  dbHost, dbUser, and possibly other parameters. It has to be noted that the window
  for such attack vectors to be possible is extremely narrow and it is very unlikely
  that such an attack could be actually effective.
