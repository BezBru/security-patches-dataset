details: Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Special Element Injection.
  Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance.
  Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical
  usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally
  ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore
  been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create
  users within Revive Adserver.
