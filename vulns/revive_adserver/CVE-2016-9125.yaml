details: Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from session fixation, by allowing arbitrary
  session identifiers to be forced and, at the same time, by not invalidating the
  existing session upon a successful authentication. Under some circumstances, that
  could have been an opportunity for an attacker to steal an authenticated session.
