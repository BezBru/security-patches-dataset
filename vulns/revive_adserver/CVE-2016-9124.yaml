details: Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Improper Restriction of Excessive
  Authentication Attempts. The login page of Revive Adserver is vulnerable to password-guessing
  attacks. An account lockdown feature was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing
  service disruptions to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead
  been introduced as a countermeasure in case of password failures, along with a system
  to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will effectively allow the valid
  users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack is in progress.
