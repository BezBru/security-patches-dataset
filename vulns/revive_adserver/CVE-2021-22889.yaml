details: Revive Adserver before v5.2.0 is vulnerable to a reflected XSS vulnerability
  in the `statsBreakdown` parameter of stats.php (and possibly other scripts) due

  the user interface of a Revive Adserver instance into clicking on a specifically
  crafted URL and pressing a certain key combination to execute injected JavaScript
  code.
