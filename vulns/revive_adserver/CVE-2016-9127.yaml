details: Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
  The password recovery form in Revive Adserver is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This
  vulnerability could be exploited to send a large number of password recovery emails
  to the registered users, especially in conjunction with a bug that caused recovery
  emails to be sent to all the users at once. Both issues have been fixed.
