details: In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1,
  a crafted TFLite model can force a node to have as input a tensor backed by a `nullptr`
  buffer. This can be achieved by changing a buffer index in the flatbuffer serialization
  to convert a read-only tensor to a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these
  buffers are written to before a possible read, hence they are initialized with `nullptr`.
  However, by changing the buffer index for a tensor and implicitly converting that
  tensor to be a read-write one, as there is nothing in the model that writes to it,
  we get a null pointer dereference. The issue is patched in commit 0b5662bc, and
  is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
