details: '** DISPUTED ** In Libgcrypt 1.8.4, the C implementation of AES is vulnerable
  to a flush-and-reload side-channel attack because physical addresses are available
  to other processes. (The C implementation is used on platforms where an assembly-language
  implementation is unavailable.) NOTE: the vendor''s position is that the issue report
  cannot be validated because there is no description of an attack.'
