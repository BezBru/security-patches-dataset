details: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.7.8
  rendering of d-popover tooltips can be susceptible to XSS attacks. This vulnerability
  only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourse's default Content Security
  Policy. This issue is patched in the latest `stable` 2.7.8 version of Discourse.
  As a workaround users may ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and
  has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.
