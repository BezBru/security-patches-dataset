details: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any
  private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed
  to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control
  for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the
  posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic
  commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to
  upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed`
  branch.
