details: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected
  versions maliciously crafted requests could lead to remote code execution. This
  resulted from a lack of validation in subscribe_url values. This issue is patched
  in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. To workaround
  the issue without updating, requests with a path starting /webhooks/aws path could
  be blocked at an upstream proxy.
