details: October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel
  PHP Framework. In October before version 1.1.2, when running on poorly configured
  servers (i.e. the server routes any request, regardless of the HOST header to an
  October CMS instance) the potential exists for Host Header Poisoning attacks to
  succeed. This has been addressed in version 1.1.2 by adding a feature to allow a
  set of trusted hosts to be specified in the application. As a workaround one may
  set the configuration setting cms.linkPolicy to force.
