details: 'In OctoberCMS (october/october composer package) versions from 1.0.319 and
  before 1.0.466, any users with the ability to modify any data that could eventually
  be exported as a CSV file from the `ImportExportController` could potentially introduce
  a CSV injection into the data to cause the generated CSV export file to be malicious.
  This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful attack can
  be completed: 1. Have found a vulnerability in the victims spreadsheet software
  of choice. 2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController`
  by a theoretical victim. 3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and
  run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks
  by said software. Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466).'
