details: October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel
  PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.469, an
  authenticated backend user with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials
  permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed
  by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific Twig
  code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem
  for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage
  PHP within the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem
  for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions
  in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been
  patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.
