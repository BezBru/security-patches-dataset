details: October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel
  PHP Framework. A bypass of CVE-2020-15247 (fixed in 1.0.469 and 1.1.0) was discovered
  that has the same impact as CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the
  cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions who would
  normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode
  being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and
  execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users
  with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having
  cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode
  to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to
  write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) and
  v1.1.1.
