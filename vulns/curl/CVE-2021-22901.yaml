details: curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting
  in already freed memory being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a
  connection. A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to
  potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time
  sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores
  pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket
  arrives. If the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1
  connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer object might be
  freed before the new session is established on that connection and then the function
  will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory, libcurl
  might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote
  code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content
  into the correct place in memory.
