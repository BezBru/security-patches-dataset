details: curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to wrong
  session due to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST when libcurl is
  built to use the Schannel TLS library. The selected cipher set was stored in a single
  "static" variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if an
  application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers
  will accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario,
  this weakens transport security significantly.
