details: Sulu is an open-source PHP content management system based on the Symfony
  framework. In affected versions Sulu users who have access to any subset of the
  admin UI are able to elevate their privilege. Over the API it was possible for them
  to give themselves permissions to areas which they did not already had. This issue
  was introduced in 2.0.0-RC1 with the new ProfileController putAction. The versions
  have been patched in 2.2.18, 2.3.8 and 2.4.0. For users unable to upgrade the only
  known workaround is to apply a patch to the ProfileController manually.
