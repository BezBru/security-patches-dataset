details: Sulu is an open-source PHP content management system based on the Symfony
  framework. In affected versions an attacker can read arbitrary local files via a
  PHP file include. In a default configuration this also leads to remote code execution.
  The problem is patched with the Versions 1.6.44, 2.2.18, 2.3.8, 2.4.0. For users
  unable to upgrade overwrite the service `sulu_route.generator.expression_token_provider`
  and wrap the translator before passing it to the expression language.
