details: On Windows the Veyon Service before version 4.4.2 contains an unquoted service
  path vulnerability, allowing locally authenticated users with administrative privileges
  to run malicious executables with LocalSystem privileges. Since Veyon users (both
  students and teachers) usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability
  is only dangerous in anyway unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in version
  4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation of the vulnerability can be prevented by
  revoking administrative privileges from all potentially untrustworthy users.
