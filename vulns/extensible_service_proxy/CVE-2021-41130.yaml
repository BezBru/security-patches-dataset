details: 'Extensible Service Proxy, a.k.a. ESP is a proxy which enables API management
  capabilities for JSON/REST or gRPC API services. ESPv1 can be configured to authenticate
  a JWT token. Its verified JWT claim is passed to the application by HTTP header
  "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo", the application can use it to do authorization. But if
  there are two "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" headers from the client, ESPv1 only replaces
  the first one, the 2nd one will be passed to the application. An attacker can send
  two "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" headers, the second one with a fake JWT claim. Application
  may use the fake JWT claim to do the authorization. This impacts following ESPv1
  usages: 1) Users have configured ESPv1 to do JWT authentication with Google ID Token
  as described in the referenced google endpoint document. 2) Users backend application
  is using the info in the "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" header to do the authorization.
  It has been fixed by v1.58.0. You need to patch it in the following ways: * If your
  docker image is using tag ":1", needs to re-start the container to pick up the new
  version. The tag ":1" will automatically point to the latest version. * If your
  docker image tag pings to a specific minor version, e.g. ":1.57". You need to update
  it to ":1.58" and re-start the container. There are no workaround for this issue.'
