details: rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In affected
  versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite`
  alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes
  use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different
  'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4
  of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous
  signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the
  application architecture.
