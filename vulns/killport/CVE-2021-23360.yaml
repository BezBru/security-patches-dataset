details: This affects the package killport before 1.0.2. If (attacker-controlled)
  user input is given, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
  This is due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization.
  Running this PoC will cause the command touch success to be executed, leading to
  the creation of a file called success.
