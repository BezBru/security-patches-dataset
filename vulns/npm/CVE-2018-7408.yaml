details: 'An issue was discovered in an npm 5.7.0 2018-02-21 pre-release (marked as
  "next: 5.7.0" and therefore automatically installed by an "npm upgrade -g npm" command,
  and also announced in the vendor''s blog without mention of pre-release status).
  It might allow local users to bypass intended filesystem access restrictions because
  ownerships of /etc and /usr directories are being changed unexpectedly, related
  to a "correctMkdir" issue.'
