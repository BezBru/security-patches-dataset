details: Tor Browser through 10.5.6 and 11.x through 11.0a4 allows a correlation attack
  that can compromise the privacy of visits to v2 onion addresses. Exact timestamps
  of these onion-service visits are logged locally, and an attacker might be able
  to compare them to timestamp data collected by the destination server (or collected
  by a rogue site within the Tor network).
