details: The xrdp-sesman service before version 0.9.13.1 can be crashed by connecting
  over port 3350 and supplying a malicious payload. Once the xrdp-sesman process is
  dead, an unprivileged attacker on the server could then proceed to start their own
  imposter sesman service listening on port 3350. This will allow them to capture
  any user credentials that are submitted to XRDP and approve or reject arbitrary
  login credentials. For xorgxrdp sessions in particular, this allows an unauthorized
  user to hijack an existing session. This is a buffer overflow attack, so there may
  be a risk of arbitrary code execution as well.
