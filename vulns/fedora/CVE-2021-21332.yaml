details: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
  matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
  VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse
  was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the
  configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to
  cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources
  served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.
