details: "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization.\
  \ A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy files using `docker\
  \ cp` into a specially-crafted container can result in Unix file permission changes\
  \ for existing files in the host\u2019s filesystem, widening access to others. This\
  \ bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an\
  \ additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine)\
  \ 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers\
  \ do not need to be restarted."
