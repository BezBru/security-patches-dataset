details: Docker CLI is the command line interface for the docker container runtime.
  A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com`
  with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing
  a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided
  credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private
  registry. This bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9. Users should update to
  this version as soon as possible. For users unable to update ensure that any configured
  credsStore or credHelpers entries in the configuration file reference an installed
  credential helper that is executable and on the PATH.
