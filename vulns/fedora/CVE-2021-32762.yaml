details: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. The redis-cli
  command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable to integer overflow
  when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk network replies. This is a result
  of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis library which does not perform an overflow
  check before calling the calloc() heap allocation function. This issue only impacts
  systems with heap allocators that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most
  modern systems do and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by default
  redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc allocator which is also not vulnerable. The problem
  is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.
