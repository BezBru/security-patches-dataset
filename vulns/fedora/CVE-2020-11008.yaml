details: 'Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked
  into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. This bug is
  similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the
  door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot
  control which one). Git uses external "credential helper" programs to store and
  retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating
  system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published
  Git versions can cause Git to send a "blank" pattern to helpers, missing hostname
  and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and
  will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker''s
  server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`.
  However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through
  systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules,
  or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which
  should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the
  vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers
  which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git''s "store" helper - Git''s "cache"
  helper - the "osxkeychain" helper that ships in Git''s "contrib" directory Credential
  helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential
  Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the
  vulnerability.'
