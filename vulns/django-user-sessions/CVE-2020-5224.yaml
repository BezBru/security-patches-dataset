details: In Django User Sessions (django-user-sessions) before 1.7.1, the views provided
  allow users to terminate specific sessions. The session key is used to identify
  sessions, and thus included in the rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem.
  However if the website has an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted
  by the attacker and a session takeover could happen.
