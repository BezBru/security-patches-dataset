details: When libvirtd is configured by OSP director (tripleo-heat-templates) to use
  the TLS transport it defaults to the same certificate authority as all non-libvirtd
  services. As no additional authentication is configured this allows these services
  to connect to libvirtd (which is equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability
  exists in another service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate
  privileges to gain control over compute nodes.
