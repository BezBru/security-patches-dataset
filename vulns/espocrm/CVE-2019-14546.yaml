details: An issue was discovered in EspoCRM before 5.6.9. Stored XSS was executed
  on the Preference page as well as while sending an email when a malicious payload
  was inserted inside the Email Signature in the Preference page. The attacker could
  insert malicious JavaScript inside his email signature, which fires when the victim
  replies or forwards the mail, thus helping him steal victims' cookies (hence compromising
  their accounts).
