details: Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid
  development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. Netty prior
  to version 4.1.7.1.Final skips control chars when they are present at the beginning
  / end of the header name. It should instead fail fast as these are not allowed by
  the spec and could lead to HTTP request smuggling. Failing to do the validation
  might cause netty to "sanitize" header names before it forward these to another
  remote system when used as proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid usage
  anymore, and therefore does not do the validation itself. Users should upgrade to
  version 4.1.7.1.Final to receive a patch.
