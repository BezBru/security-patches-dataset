details: Tough provides a set of Rust libraries and tools for using and generating
  the update framework (TUF) repositories. The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does
  not properly sanitize target names when caching a repository, or when saving specific
  targets to an output directory. When targets are cached or saved, files could be
  overwritten with arbitrary content anywhere on the system. A fix is available in
  version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue are known.
