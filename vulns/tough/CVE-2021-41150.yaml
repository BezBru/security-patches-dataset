details: Tough provides a set of Rust libraries and tools for using and generating
  the update framework (TUF) repositories. The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does
  not properly sanitize delegated role names when caching a repository, or when loading
  a repository from the filesystem. When the repository is cached or loaded, files
  ending with the .json extension could be overwritten with role metadata anywhere
  on the system. A fix is available in version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue
  are known.
