details: 'Python oic is a Python OpenID Connect implementation. In Python oic before
  version 1.2.1, there are several related cryptographic issues affecting client implementations
  that use the library. The issues are: 1) The IdToken signature algorithm was not
  checked automatically, but only if the expected algorithm was passed in as a kwarg.
  2) JWA `none` algorithm was allowed in all flows. 3) oic.consumer.Consumer.parse_authz
  returns an unverified IdToken. The verification of the token was left to the discretion
  of the implementator. 4) iat claim was not checked for sanity (i.e. it could be
  in the future). These issues are patched in version 1.2.1.'
