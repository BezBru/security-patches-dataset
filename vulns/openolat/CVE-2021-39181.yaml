details: OpenOlat is a web-based learning management system (LMS). Prior to version
  15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0, using a prepared import XML file (e.g. a course) any
  class on the Java classpath can be instantiated, including spring AOP bean factories.
  This can be used to execute code arbitrary code by the attacker. The attack requires
  an OpenOlat user account with the authoring role. It can not be exploited by unregistered
  users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. There are no
  known workarounds aside from upgrading.
