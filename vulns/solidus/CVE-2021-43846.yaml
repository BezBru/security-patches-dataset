details: '`solidus_frontend` is the cart and storefront for the Solidus e-commerce
  project. Versions of `solidus_frontend` prior to 3.1.5, 3.0.5, and 2.11.14 contain
  a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows a malicious site to
  add an item to the user''s cart without their knowledge. Versions 3.1.5, 3.0.5,
  and 2.11.14 contain a patch for this issue. The patch adds CSRF token verification
  to the "Add to cart" action. Adding forgery protection to a form that missed it
  can have some side effects. Other CSRF protection strategies as well as a workaround
  involving modifcation to config/application.rb` are available. More details on these
  mitigations are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.'
