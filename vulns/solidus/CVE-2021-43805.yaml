details: Solidus is a free, open-source ecommerce platform built on Rails. Versions
  of Solidus prior to 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have a denial of service vulnerability
  that could be exploited during a guest checkout. The regular expression used to
  validate a guest order's email was subject to exponential backtracking through a
  fragment like `a.a.` Versions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use
  a different regular expression. The maintainers added a check for email addresses
  that are no longer valid that will print information about any affected orders that
  exist. If a prompt upgrade is not an option, a workaround is available. It is possible
  to edit the file `config/application.rb` manually (with code provided by the maintainers
  in the GitHub Security Advisory) to check email validity.
