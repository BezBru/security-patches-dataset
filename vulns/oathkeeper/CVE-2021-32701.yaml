details: 'ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision
  API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a
  request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted
  with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached.
  The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope
  `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not
  to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`.
  Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When
  caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in
  [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152).
  From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97)
  it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the
  token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424.
  During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which
  is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.'
