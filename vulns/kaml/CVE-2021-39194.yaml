details: kaml is an open source implementation of the YAML format with support for
  kotlinx.serialization. In affected versions attackers that could provide arbitrary
  YAML input to an application that uses kaml could cause the application to endlessly
  loop while parsing the input. This could result in resource starvation and denial
  of service. This only affects applications that use polymorphic serialization with
  the default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property polymorphism
  style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type that provided a tag but
  no value for the object would trigger the issue. Version 0.35.3 or later contain
  the fix for this issue.
