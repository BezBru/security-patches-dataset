  disclose Authorization headers to incorrect domain in certain redirect scenarios.
  The conditions in which this happens are if consumers of the http-client: 1. make
  an http request with an authorization header 2. that request leads to a redirect
  (302) and 3. the redirect url redirects to another domain or hostname Then the authorization
  header will get passed to the other domain. The problem is fixed in version 1.0.8.'
