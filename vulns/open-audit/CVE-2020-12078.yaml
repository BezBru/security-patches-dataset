details: An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter
  injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit
  this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally
  called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the
  discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered,
  which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.
