details: Zope is an open-source web application server. Zope versions prior to versions
  4.6.3 and 5.3 have a remote code execution security issue. In order to be affected,
  one must use Python 3 for one's Zope deployment, run Zope 4 below version 4.6.3
  or Zope 5 below version 5.3, and have the optional `Products.PythonScripts` add-on
  package installed. By default, one must have the admin-level Zope "Manager" role
  to add or edit Script (Python) objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted
  users to add/edit these scripts through the web are at risk. Zope releases 4.6.3
  and 5.3 are not vulnerable. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing
  Script (Python) objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission
  mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing
  these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is
  the default configuration in Zope.
