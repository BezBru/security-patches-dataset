details: ViewVC before versions 1.1.28 and 1.2.1 has a XSS vulnerability in CVS show_subdir_lastmod
  support. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker
  to have commit privileges to a CVS repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC
  instance that also has the `show_subdir_lastmod` feature enabled. The attack vector
  involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream,
  would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging
  to create. This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.2.1 and 1.1.28.
