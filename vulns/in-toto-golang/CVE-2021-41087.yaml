details: in-toto-golang is a go implementation of the in-toto framework to protect
  software supply chain integrity. In affected versions authenticated attackers posing
  as functionaries (i.e., within a trusted set of users for a layout) are able to
  create attestations that may bypass DISALLOW rules in the same layout. An attacker
  with access to trusted private keys, may issue an attestation that contains a disallowed
  artifact by including path traversal semantics (e.g., foo vs dir/../foo). Exploiting
  this vulnerability is dependent on the specific policy applied. The problem has
  been fixed in version 0.3.0.
