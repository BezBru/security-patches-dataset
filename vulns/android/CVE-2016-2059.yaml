details: The msm_ipc_router_bind_control_port function in net/ipc_router/ipc_router_core.c
  in the IPC router kernel module for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation
  Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not
  verify that a port is a client port, which allows attackers to gain privileges or
  cause a denial of service (race condition and list corruption) by making many BIND_CONTROL_PORT
  ioctl calls.
