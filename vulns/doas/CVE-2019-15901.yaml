details: 'An issue was discovered in slicer69 doas before 6.2 on certain platforms
  other than OpenBSD. A setusercontext(3) call with flags to change the UID, primary
  GID, and secondary GIDs was replaced (on certain platforms: Linux and possibly NetBSD)
  with a single setuid(2) call. This resulted in neither changing the group id nor
  initializing secondary group ids.'
