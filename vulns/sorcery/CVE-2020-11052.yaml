details: In Sorcery before 0.15.0, there is a brute force vulnerability when using
  password authentication via Sorcery. The brute force protection submodule will prevent
  a brute force attack for the defined lockout period, but once expired, protection
  will not be re-enabled until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This
  does not affect users that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule,
  nor users that use permanent account lockout. This has been patched in 0.15.0.
