details: Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph before version
  3.30.0 has two potential information leaks. The site-admin area can be accessed
  by regular users and all information and features are properly protected except
  for daily usage statistics and code intelligence uploads and indexes. It is not
  possible to alter the information, nor interact with any other features in the site-admin
  area. The issue is patched in version 3.30.0, where the information cannot be accessed
  by unprivileged users. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.
