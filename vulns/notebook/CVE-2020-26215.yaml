details: Jupyter Notebook before version 6.1.5 has an Open redirect vulnerability.
  A maliciously crafted link to a notebook server could redirect the browser to a
  different website. All notebook servers are technically affected, however, these
  maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known notebook server
  hosts. A link to your notebook server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to
  a spoofed server on the public internet. The issue is patched in version 6.1.5.
