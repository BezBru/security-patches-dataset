details: pcapture is an open source dumpcap web service interface . In affected versions
  this vulnerability allows an authenticated but unprivileged user to use the REST
  API to capture and download packets with no capture filter and without adequate
  permissions. This is important because the capture filters can effectively limit
  the scope of information that a user can see in the data captures. If no filter
  is present, then all data on the local network segment where the program is running
  can be captured and downloaded. v3.12 fixes this problem. There is no workaround,
  you must upgrade to v3.12 or greater.
