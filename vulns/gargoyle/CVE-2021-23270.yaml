details: In Gargoyle OS 1.12.0, when IPv6 is used, a routing loop can occur that generates
  excessive network traffic between an affected device and its upstream ISP's router.
  This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination
  IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router
  advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which
  the on-link flag is set.
