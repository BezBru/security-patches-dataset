details: "The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang.\
  \ Affected versions of the SDK were vulnerable to a consensus halt due to non-deterministic\
  \ behaviour in a ValidateBasic method in the x/authz module. The MsgGrant of the\
  \ x/authz module contains a Grant field which includes a user-defined expiration\
  \ time for when the authorization grant expires. In Grant.ValidateBasic(), that\
  \ time is compared to the node\xE2\u20AC\u2122s local clock time. Any chain running\
  \ an affected version of the SDK with the authz module enabled could be halted by\
  \ anyone with the ability to send transactions on that chain. Recovery would require\
  \ applying the patch and rolling back the latest block. Users are advised to update\
  \ to version 0.44.2."
