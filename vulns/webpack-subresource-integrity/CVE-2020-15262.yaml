details: In webpack-subresource-integrity before version 1.5.1, all dynamically loaded
  chunks receive an invalid integrity hash that is ignored by the browser, and therefore
  the browser cannot validate their integrity. This removes the additional level of
  protection offered by SRI for such chunks. Top-level chunks are unaffected. This
  issue is patched in version 1.5.1.
