details: Red Discord Bot before version 3.4.1 has an unauthorized privilege escalation
  exploit in the Mod module. This exploit allows Discord users with a high privilege
  level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the application is in a specific
  condition that is beyond that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it is possible
  to perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high privileges in.
  This exploit has been fixed in version 3.4.1. As a workaround, unloading the Mod
  module with unload mod or, disabling the massban command with command disable global
  massban can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating
  to 3.4.1 to completely patch this issue.
