details: better_errors is an open source replacement for the standard Rails error
  page with more information rich error pages. It is also usable outside of Rails
  in any Rack app as Rack middleware. better_errors prior to 2.8.0 did not implement
  CSRF protection for its internal requests. It also did not enforce the correct "Content-Type"
  header for these requests, which allowed a cross-origin "simple request" to be made
  without CORS protection. These together left an application with better_errors enabled
  open to cross-origin attacks. As a developer tool, better_errors documentation strongly
  recommends addition only to the `development` bundle group, so this vulnerability
  should only affect development environments. Please ensure that your project limits
  better_errors to the `development` group (or the non-Rails equivalent). Starting
  with release 2.8.x, CSRF protection is enforced. It is recommended that you upgrade
  to the latest release, or minimally to "~> 2.8.3". There are no known workarounds
  to mitigate the risk of using older releases of better_errors.
