details: jupyterhub-systemdspawner enables JupyterHub to spawn single-user notebook
  servers using systemd. In jupyterhub-systemdspawner before version 0.15 user API
  tokens issued to single-user servers are specified in the environment of systemd
  units. These tokens are incorrectly accessible to all users. In particular, the-littlest-jupyterhub
  is affected, which uses systemdspawner by default. This is patched in jupyterhub-systemdspawner
