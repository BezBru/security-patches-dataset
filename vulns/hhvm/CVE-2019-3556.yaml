details: HHVM supports the use of an "admin" server which accepts administrative requests
  over HTTP. One of those request handlers, dump-pcre-cache, can be used to output
  cached regular expressions from the current execution context into a file. The handler
  takes a parameter which specifies where on the filesystem to write this data. The
  parameter is not validated, allowing a malicious user to overwrite arbitrary files
  where the user running HHVM has write access. This issue affects HHVM versions prior
  to 4.56.2, all versions between 4.57.0 and 4.78.0, as well as 4.79.0, 4.80.0, 4.81.0,
  4.82.0, and 4.83.0.
