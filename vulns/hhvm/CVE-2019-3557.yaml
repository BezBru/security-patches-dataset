details: The implementations of streams for bz2 and php://output improperly implemented
  their readImpl functions, returning -1 consistently. This behavior caused some stream
  functions, such as stream_get_line, to trigger an out-of-bounds read when operating
  on such malformed streams. The implementations were updated to return valid values
  consistently. This affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30 and 3.27.4 and below).
