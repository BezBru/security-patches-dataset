details: HHVM does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts
  and therefore does not protect CGI applications from the presence of untrusted client
  data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers
  to redirect a CGI application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server
  via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue. This issue
  affects HHVM versions prior to 3.9.6, all versions between 3.10.0 and 3.12.4 (inclusive),
  and all versions between 3.13.0 and 3.14.2 (inclusive).
