details: There is a possible XSS vulnerability in all rails-html-sanitizer gem versions
  below 1.0.4 for Ruby. The gem allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in
  sanitized output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these attributes
  can lead to an XSS attack on target applications. This issue is similar to CVE-2018-8048
  in Loofah. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one
  of the workarounds immediately.
