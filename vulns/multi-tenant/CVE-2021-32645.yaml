details: 'Tenancy multi-tenant is an open source multi-domain controller for the Laravel
  web framework. In some situations, it is possible to have open redirects where users
  can be redirected from your site to any other site using a specially crafted URL.
  This is only the case for installations where the default Hostname Identification
  is used and the environment uses tenants that have `force_https` set to `true` (default:
  `false`). Version 5.7.2 contains the relevant patches to fix this bug. Stripping
  the URL from special characters to prevent specially crafted URL''s from being redirected
  to. As a work around users can set the `force_https` to every tenant to `false`,
  however this may degrade connection security.'
