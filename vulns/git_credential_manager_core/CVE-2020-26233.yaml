details: Git Credential Manager Core (GCM Core) is a secure Git credential helper
  built on .NET Core that runs on Windows and macOS. In Git Credential Manager Core
  before version 2.0.289, when recursively cloning a Git repository on Windows with
  submodules, Git will first clone the top-level repository and then recursively clone
  all submodules by starting new Git processes from the top-level working directory.
  If a malicious git.exe executable is present in the top-level repository then this
  binary will be started by Git Credential Manager Core when attempting to read configuration,
  and not git.exe as found on the %PATH%. This only affects GCM Core on Windows, not
  macOS or Linux-based distributions. GCM Core version 2.0.289 contains the fix for
  this vulnerability, and is available from the project's GitHub releases page. GCM
  Core 2.0.289 is also bundled in the latest Git for Windows release; version 2.29.2(3).
  As a workaround, users should avoid recursively cloning untrusted repositories with
  the --recurse-submodules option.
