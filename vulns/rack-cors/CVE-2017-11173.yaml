details: Missing anchor in generated regex for rack-cors before 0.4.1 allows a malicious
  third-party site to perform CORS requests. If the configuration were intended to
  allow only the trusted example.com domain name and not the malicious example.net
  domain name, then example.com.example.net (as well as example.com-example.net) would
  be inadvertently allowed.
