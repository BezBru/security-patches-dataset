details: Gradio is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning
  models and demos. In versions prior to 2.5.0 there is a vulnerability that affects
  anyone who creates and publicly shares Gradio interfaces. File paths are not restricted
  and users who receive a Gradio link can access any files on the host computer if

  2.5.0.
