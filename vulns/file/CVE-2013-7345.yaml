details: The BEGIN regular expression in the awk script detector in magic/Magdir/commands
  in file before 5.15 uses multiple wildcards with unlimited repetitions, which allows
  context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a
  crafted ASCII file that triggers a large amount of backtracking, as demonstrated
  via a file with many newline characters.
