details: The System Information Library for Node.JS (npm package "systeminformation")
  is an open source collection of functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system
  and OS information. In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command
  injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead
  of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to
  si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only
  allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.
