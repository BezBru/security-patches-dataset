details: In MyBB before version 1.8.24, the custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual
  editor doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based
  XSS vulnerability. The weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page
  where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates
  on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content
  is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved
  malicious message is quoted. After upgrading MyBB to 1.8.24, make sure to update
  the version attribute in the `codebuttons` template for non-default themes to serve
  the latest version of the patched `jscripts/bbcodes_sceditor.js` file.
