details: 'In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur
  because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate.
  NOTE: this requires that a low public exponent (such as 3) is being used. The product,
  by default, does not generate RSA keys with such a low number.'
