details: An issue was discovered in sysPass 2.x before 2.1, in which an algorithm
  was never sufficiently reviewed by cryptographers. The fact that inc/SP/Core/Crypt.class
  is using the MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256() function (the 256-bit block version of Rijndael,
  not AES) instead of MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 (real AES) could help an attacker to create
  unknown havoc in the remote system.
