details: "JupyterLab is a user interface for Project Jupyter which will eventually\
  \ replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. In affected versions untrusted notebook\
  \ can execute code on load. In particular JupyterLab doesn\u2019t sanitize the action\
  \ attribute of html `<form>`. Using this it is possible to trigger the form validation\
  \ outside of the form itself. This is a remote code execution, but requires user\
  \ action to open a notebook."
