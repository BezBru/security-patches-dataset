details: Zulip is an open source team chat server. In affected versions Zulip allows
  organization administrators on a server to configure "linkifiers" that automatically
  create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions.
  Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service
  via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time
  regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular
  expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were
  safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS
  if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex.
  Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release),
  or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).
