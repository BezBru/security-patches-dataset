details: Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat
  with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation
  objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new
  account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect
  endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem
  was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and
  not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation
  key and be able to register. The issue is fixed in Zulip 4.8. There are no known
  workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
