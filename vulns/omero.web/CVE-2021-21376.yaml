details: OMERO.web is open source Django-based software for managing microscopy imaging.
  OMERO.web before version 5.9.0 loads various information about the current user
  such as their id, name and the groups they are in, and these are available on the
  main webclient pages. This represents an information exposure vulnerability. Some
  additional information being loaded is not used by the webclient and is being removed
  in this release. This is fixed in version 5.9.0.
