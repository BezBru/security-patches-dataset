details: Spacewalk 2.10, and derivatives such as Uyuni 2021.08, allows code injection.
  rhn-config-satellite.pl doesn't sanitize the configuration filename used to append
  Spacewalk-specific key-value pair. The script is intended to be run by the tomcat
  user account with Sudo, according to the installation setup. This can lead to the
  ability of an attacker to use --option to append arbitrary code to a root-owned
  file that eventually will be executed by the system. This is fixed in Uyuni spacewalk-admin
  4.3.2-1.
