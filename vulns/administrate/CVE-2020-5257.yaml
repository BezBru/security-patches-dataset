details: In Administrate (rubygem) before version 0.13.0, when sorting by attributes
  on a dashboard, the direction parameter was not validated before being interpolated
  into the SQL query. This could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able
  to modify the `direction` parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections. Whilst
  this does have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the Administrate
  dashboards, which we would expect to be behind authentication. This is patched in
  wersion 0.13.0.
