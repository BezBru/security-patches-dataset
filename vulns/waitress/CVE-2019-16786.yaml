details: 'Waitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header
  and only look for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would
  fall through and use the Content-Length header instead. According to the HTTP standard
  Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding
  first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent
  with: "Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked" would incorrectly get ignored, and the
  request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of
  the HTTP message. This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple
  requests in the case of HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.'
