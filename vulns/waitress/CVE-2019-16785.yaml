details: 'Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a "MAY" part of the RFC7230 which
  states: "Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the
  sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore
  any preceding CR." Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields
  with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end
  and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This
  can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may
  see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This
  issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.'
