details: Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length
  header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due
  to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the
  Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single
  request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the
  body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in
  Waitress 1.4.0.
