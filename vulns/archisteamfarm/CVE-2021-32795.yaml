details: ArchiSteamFarm is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards
  from multiple accounts simultaneously. In versions prior to 4.3.1.0 a Denial of
  Service (aka DoS) vulnerability which allows attacker to remotely crash running
  ASF instance through sending a specifically-crafted Steam chat message exists. The
  user sending the message does not need to be authorized within the bot or ASF process.
  The attacker needs to know ASF's `CommandPrefix` in advance, but majority of ASF
  setups run with an unchanged default value. This attack does not allow attacker
  to gain any potentially-sensitive information, such as logins or passwords, does
  not allow to execute arbitrary commands and otherwise exploit the crash further.
  The issue is patched in ASF V4.3.1.0. The only workaround which guarantees complete
  protection is running all bots with `OnlineStatus` of `0` (Offline). In this setup,
  ASF is able to ignore even the specifically-crafted message without attempting to
  interpret it.
