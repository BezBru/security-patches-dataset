details: In FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in asf_read_marker() due to lack of an EOF (End of
  File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted ASF file,
  which claims a large "name_len" or "count" field in the header but does not contain
  sufficient backing data, is provided, the loops over the name and markers would
  consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside these
  loops.
