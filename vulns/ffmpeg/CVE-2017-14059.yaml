details: In FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in cine_read_header() due to lack of an EOF check
  might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted CINE file, which claims
  a large "duration" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data,
  is provided, the image-offset parsing loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources,
  since there is no EOF check inside the loop.
