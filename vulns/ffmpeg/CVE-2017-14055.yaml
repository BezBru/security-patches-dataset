details: In libavformat/mvdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in mv_read_header() due to
  lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption.
  When a crafted MV file, which claims a large "nb_frames" field in the header but
  does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop over the frames
  would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside
  the loop.
