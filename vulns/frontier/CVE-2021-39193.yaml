details: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number
  0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid
  transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due
  to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way
  have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction
  will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM
  engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints. A
  patch is available in commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26. There
  are no workarounds aside from applying the patch.
