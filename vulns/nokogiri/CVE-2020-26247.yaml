details: Nokogiri is a Rubygem providing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parsers with XPath
  and CSS selector support. In Nokogiri before version 1.11.0.rc4 there is an XXE
  vulnerability. XML Schemas parsed by Nokogiri::XML::Schema are trusted by default,
  allowing external resources to be accessed over the network, potentially enabling
  XXE or SSRF attacks. This behavior is counter to the security policy followed by
  Nokogiri maintainers, which is to treat all input as untrusted by default whenever
  possible. This is fixed in Nokogiri version 1.11.0.rc4.
