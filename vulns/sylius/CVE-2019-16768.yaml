details: In affected versions of Sylius, exception messages from internal exceptions
  (like database exception) are wrapped by \Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AuthenticationServiceException
  and propagated through the system to UI. Therefore, some internal system information
  may leak and be visible to the customer. A validation message with the exception
  details will be presented to the user when one will try to log into the shop. This
  has been patched in versions 1.3.14, 1.4.10, 1.5.7, and 1.6.3.
