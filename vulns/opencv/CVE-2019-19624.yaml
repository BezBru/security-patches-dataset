details: An out-of-bounds read was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1. Specifically,
  variable coarsest_scale is assumed to be greater than or equal to finest_scale within
  the calc()/ocl_calc() functions in dis_flow.cpp. However, this is not true when
  dealing with small images, leading to an out-of-bounds read of the heap-allocated
  arrays Ux and Uy.
