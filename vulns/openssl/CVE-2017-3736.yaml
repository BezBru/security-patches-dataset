schema_version: 1.2.0
id: CVE-2017-3736
aliases: []
modified: 2019-04-23T19:30Z

details: There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure
  in OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0g. No EC algorithms are affected.
  Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would
  be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are
  considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary
  to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of
  resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only
  accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need
  online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario
  with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple
  clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions
  like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.
