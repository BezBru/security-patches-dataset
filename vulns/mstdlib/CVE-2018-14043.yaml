details: mstdlib (aka the M Standard Library for C) 1.2.0 has incorrect file access
  control in situations where M_fs_perms_can_access attempts to delete an existing
  file (that lacks public read/write access) during a copy operation, related to fs/m_fs.c
  and fs/m_fs_path.c. An attacker could create the file and then would have access
  to the data.
