details: OpenZepplin is a library for smart contract development. In affected versions
  a vulnerability in TimelockController allowed an actor with the executor role to
  escalate privileges. Further details about the vulnerability will be disclosed at
  a later date. As a workaround revoke the executor role from accounts not strictly
  under the team's control. We recommend revoking all executors that are not also
  proposers. When applying this mitigation, ensure there is at least one proposer
  and executor remaining.
