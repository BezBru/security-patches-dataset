details: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. In affected
  versions upgradeable contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` may be vulnerable to an attack
  affecting uninitialized implementation contracts. A fix is included in version 4.3.2
  of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`. For users
  unable to upgrade; initialize implementation contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` by
  invoking the initializer function (usually called `initialize`). An example is provided
  [in the forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301).
