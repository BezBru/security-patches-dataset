details: Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application
  written in PHP. In TimeTracker before version 1.19.24.5415 tokens used in password
  reset feature in Time Tracker are based on system time and, therefore, are predictable.
  This opens a window for brute force attacks to guess user tokens and, once successful,
  change user passwords, including that of a system administrator. This vulnerability
  is pathced in version 1.19.24.5415 (started to use more secure tokens) with an additional
  improvement in 1.19.24.5416 (limited an available window for brute force token guessing).
