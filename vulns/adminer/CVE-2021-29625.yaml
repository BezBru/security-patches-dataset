details: Adminer is open-source database management software. A cross-site scripting
  vulnerability in Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 affects users of MySQL, MariaDB,
  PgSQL and SQLite. XSS is in most cases prevented by strict CSP in all modern browsers.
  The only exception is when Adminer is using a `pdo_` extension to communicate with
  the database (it is used if the native extensions are not enabled). In browsers
  without CSP, Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 are affected. The vulnerability is
  patched in version 4.8.1. As workarounds, one can use a browser supporting strict
  CSP or enable the native PHP extensions (e.g. `mysqli`) or disable displaying PHP
  errors (`display_errors`).
