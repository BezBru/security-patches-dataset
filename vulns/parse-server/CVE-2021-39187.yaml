details: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query
  request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug
  in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot
  catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from
  upgrading are known to exist.
