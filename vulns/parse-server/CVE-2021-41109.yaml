details: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries,
  the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is
  currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class,
  all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the
  LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery
  payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger
  to make the user private already on sign-up.
