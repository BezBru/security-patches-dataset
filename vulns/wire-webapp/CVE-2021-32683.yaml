details: wire-webapp is the web version of Wire, an open-source messenger. A cross-site
  scripting vulnerability exists in wire-webapp prior to version 2021-06-01-production.0.
  If a user is instructed to open an image in a new tab (right click -> open in new
  tab, or copy the URL and paste it in the URL bar), an the image payload is executed
  on the domain hosting the app (app.wire.com). In particular, if an image contains
  malicious code in addition to the actual picture, this code is executed on app.wire.com.
  This allows the attacker to fully control the user account. The vulnerability was
  patched in version 2021-06-01-production.0. As a workaround, users should not try
  to open image URLs.
