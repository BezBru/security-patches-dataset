details: HedgeDoc is open source software which lets you create real-time collaborative
  markdown notes. In HedgeDoc before version 1.7.2, an attacker can inject arbitrary
  JavaScript into a HedgeDoc note, which is executed when the note is viewed in slide
  mode. Depending on the configuration of the instance, the attacker may not need
  authentication to create or edit notes. The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.2.
  As a workaround, disallow loading JavaScript from 3rd party sites using the `Content-Security-Policy`
  header. Note that this will break some embedded content.
