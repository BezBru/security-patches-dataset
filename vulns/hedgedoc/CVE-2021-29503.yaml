details: HedgeDoc is a platform to write and share markdown. HedgeDoc before version
  1.8.2 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack using the YAML-metadata of
  a note. An attacker with write access to a note can embed HTML tags in the Open
  Graph metadata section of the note, resulting in the frontend rendering the script
  tag as part of the `<head>` section. Unless your instance prevents guests from editing
  notes, this vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to inject JavaScript
  into notes that allow guest edits. If your instance prevents guests from editing
  notes, this vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to inject JavaScript into
  any note pages they have write-access to. This vulnerability is patched in version
  1.8.2. As a workaround, one can disable guest edits until the next update.
