details: HedgeDoc is a collaborative platform for writing and sharing markdown. In
  HedgeDoc before version 1.7.1 an unauthenticated attacker can upload arbitrary files
  to the upload storage backend including HTML, JS and PHP files. The problem is patched
  in HedgeDoc 1.7.1. You should however verify that your uploaded file storage only
  contains files that are allowed, as uploaded files might still be served. As workaround
  it's possible to block the `/uploadimage` endpoint on your instance using your reverse
  proxy. And/or restrict MIME-types and file names served from your upload file storage.
