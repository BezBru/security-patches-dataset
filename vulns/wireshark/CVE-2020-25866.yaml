details: In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.6 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.13, the BLIP protocol dissector
  has a NULL pointer dereference because a buffer was sized for compressed (not uncompressed)
  messages. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-blip.c by allowing reasonable
  compression ratios and rejecting ZIP bombs.
