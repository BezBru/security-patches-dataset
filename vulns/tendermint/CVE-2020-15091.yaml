details: TenderMint from version 0.33.0 and before version 0.33.6 allows block proposers
  to include signatures for the wrong block. This may happen naturally if you start
  a network, have it run for some time and restart it (**without changing chainID**).
  A malicious block proposer (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability
  to completely halt the network. This issue is fixed in Tendermint 0.33.6 which checks
  all the signatures are for the block with 2/3+ majority before creating a commit.
