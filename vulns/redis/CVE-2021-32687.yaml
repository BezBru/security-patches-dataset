details: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer
  overflow bug affecting all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap
  and potentially be used to leak arbitrary contents of the heap or trigger remote
  code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default set-max-intset-entries
  configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted
  commands to manipulate sets. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16
  and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
  redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the set-max-intset-entries
  configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users
  from using the CONFIG SET command.
