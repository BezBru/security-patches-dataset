details: evm is a pure Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. Prior to the
  patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related to memory operations that use
  `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the `evm` crate can over-allocate memory when it
  is not needed, making it possible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack.
  The flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`. Users should upgrade to `==0.21.1, ==0.23.1,
  ==0.24.1, ==0.25.1, >=0.26.1`. There are no workarounds. Please upgrade your `evm`
  crate version.
