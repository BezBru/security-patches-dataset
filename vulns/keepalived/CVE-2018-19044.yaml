details: keepalived 2.0.8 didn't check for pathnames with symlinks when writing data
  to a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. This allowed local users
  to overwrite arbitrary files if fs.protected_symlinks is set to 0, as demonstrated
  by a symlink from /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats to /etc/passwd.
