details: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case
  data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports
  (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system
  are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion
  of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields
  and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved
  in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade
  their package.
