details: "http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions\
  \ http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted\
  \ user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\xE5\
  ), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI\
  \ paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21).\
  \ This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27\
  \ perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications\
  \ should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a\
  \ request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters\
  \ are the most threatening."
