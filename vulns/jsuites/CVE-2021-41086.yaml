details: jsuites is an open source collection of common required javascript web components.
  In affected versions users are subject to cross site scripting (XSS) attacks via
  clipboard content. jsuites is vulnerable to DOM based XSS if the user can be tricked
  into copying _anything_ from a malicious and pasting it into the html editor. This
  is because a part of the clipboard content is directly written to `innerHTML` allowing
  for javascript injection and thus XSS. Users are advised to update to version 4.9.11
  to resolve.
