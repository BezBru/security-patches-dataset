details: An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby
  through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack out-of-bounds write in
  onigenc_unicode_get_case_fold_codes_by_str() occurs during regular expression compilation.
  Code point 0xFFFFFFFF is not properly handled in unicode_unfold_key(). A malformed
  regular expression could result in 4 bytes being written off the end of a stack
  buffer of expand_case_fold_string() during the call to onigenc_unicode_get_case_fold_codes_by_str(),
  a typical stack buffer overflow.
