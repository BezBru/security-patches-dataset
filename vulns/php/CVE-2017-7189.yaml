aliases: []

details: main/streams/xp_socket.c in PHP 7.x before 2017-03-07 misparses fsockopen
  calls, such as by interpreting fsockopen('127.0.0.1:80', 443) as if the address/port
  were 127.0.0.1:80:443, which is later truncated to 127.0.0.1:80. This behavior has
  a security risk if the explicitly provided port number (i.e., 443 in this example)
  is hardcoded into an application as a security policy, but the hostname argument
  (i.e., 127.0.0.1:80 in this example) is obtained from untrusted input.
