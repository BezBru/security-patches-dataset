details: An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby
  through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs
  in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized
  variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class()
  could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized
  until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.
