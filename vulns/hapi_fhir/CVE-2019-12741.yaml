details: XSS exists in the HAPI FHIR testpage overlay module of the HAPI FHIR library
  before 3.8.0. The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output in a
  form page, allowing attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information from
  ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java via a specially crafted URL. (This module is
  not generally used in production systems so the attack surface is expected to be
  low, but affected systems are recommended to upgrade immediately.)
