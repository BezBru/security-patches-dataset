details: In symfony/security-http before versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7, when a `Firewall`
  checks access control rule, it iterate overs each rule's attributes and stops as
  soon as the accessDecisionManager decides to grant access on the attribute, preventing
  the check of next attributes that should have been take into account in an unanimous
  strategy. The accessDecisionManager is now called with all attributes at once, allowing
  the unanimous strategy being applied on each attribute. This issue is patched in
  versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7.
