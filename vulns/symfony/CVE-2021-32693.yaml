details: Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
  reusable PHP components. A vulnerability related to firewall authentication is in
  Symfony starting with version 5.3.0 and prior to 5.3.2. When an application defines
  multiple firewalls, the token authenticated by one of the firewalls was available
  for all other firewalls. This could be abused when the application defines different
  providers for each part of the application, in such a situation, a user authenticated
  on a part of the application could be considered authenticated on the rest of the
  application. Starting in version 5.3.2, a patch ensures that the authenticated token
  is only available for the firewall that generates it.
