details: The Crumb plugin before 3.0.0 for Node.js does not properly restrict token
  access in situations where a hapi route handler has CORS enabled, which allows remote
  attackers to obtain sensitive information, and potentially obtain the ability to
  spoof requests to non-CORS routes, via a crafted web site that is visited by an
  application consumer.
