details: An issue was discovered in MISP 2.4.108. Organization admins could reset
  credentials for site admins (organization admins have the inherent ability to reset
  passwords for all of their organization's users). This, however, could be abused
  in a situation where the host organization of an instance creates organization admins.
  An organization admin could set a password manually for the site admin or simply
  use the API key of the site admin to impersonate them. The potential for abuse only
  occurs when the host organization creates lower-privilege organization admins instead
  of the usual site admins. Also, only organization admins of the same organization
  as the site admin could abuse this.
