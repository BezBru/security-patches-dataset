details: The hhvm-attach deep link handler in Nuclide did not properly sanitize the
  provided hostname parameter when rendering. As a result, a malicious URL could be
  used to render HTML and other content inside of the editor's context, which could
  potentially be chained to lead to code execution. This issue affected Nuclide prior
  to v0.290.0.
