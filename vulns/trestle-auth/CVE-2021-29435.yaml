details: trestle-auth is an authentication plugin for the Trestle admin framework.
  A vulnerability in trestle-auth versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 allows an attacker to create
  a form that will bypass Rails' built-in CSRF protection when submitted by a victim
  with a trestle-auth admin session. This potentially allows an attacker to alter
  protected data, including admin account credentials. The vulnerability has been
  fixed in trestle-auth 0.4.2 released to RubyGems.
