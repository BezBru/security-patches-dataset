details: In BookStack before version 0.30.4, a user with permissions to edit a page
  could add an attached link which would execute untrusted JavaScript code when clicked
  by a viewer of the page. Dangerous content may remain in the database after this
  update. If you think this could have been exploited the linked advisory provides
  a SQL query to test. As a workaround, page edit permissions could be limited to
  only those that are trusted until you can upgrade although this will not address
  existing exploitation of this vulnerability. The issue is fixed in version 0.30.4.
