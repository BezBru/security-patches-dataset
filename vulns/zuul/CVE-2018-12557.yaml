details: An issue was discovered in Zuul 3.x before 3.1.0. If nodes become offline
  during the build, the no_log attribute of a task is ignored. If the unreachable
  error occurred in a task used with a loop variable (e.g., with_items), the contents
  of the loop items would be printed in the console. This could lead to accidentally
  leaking credentials or secrets.
