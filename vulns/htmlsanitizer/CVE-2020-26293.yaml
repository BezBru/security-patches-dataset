details: HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and documents
  from constructs that can lead to XSS attacks. In HtmlSanitizer before version 5.0.372,
  there is a possible XSS bypass if style tag is allowed. If you have explicitly allowed
  the `<style>` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing
  through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there
  is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag. The problem has
  been fixed in version 5.0.372.
