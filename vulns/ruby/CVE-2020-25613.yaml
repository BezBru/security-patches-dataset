details: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.5.8, 2.6.x through 2.6.6, and 2.7.x
  through 2.7.1. WEBrick, a simple HTTP server bundled with Ruby, had not checked
  the transfer-encoding header value rigorously. An attacker may potentially exploit
  this issue to bypass a reverse proxy (which also has a poor header check), which
  may lead to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.
