details: In affected versions of dojox (NPM package), the jqMix method is vulnerable
  to Prototype Pollution. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties
  into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. An attacker
  manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application
  object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. This has been patched
  in versions 1.11.10, 1.12.8, 1.13.7, 1.14.6, 1.15.3 and 1.16.2
