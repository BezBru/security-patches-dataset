details: Node-Red is a low-code programming for event-driven applications built using
  nodejs. Node-RED 1.2.7 and earlier has a vulnerability which allows arbitrary path
  traversal via the Projects API. If the Projects feature is enabled, a user with
  `projects.read` permission is able to access any file via the Projects API. The
  issue has been patched in Node-RED 1.2.8. The vulnerability applies only to the
  Projects feature which is not enabled by default in Node-RED. The primary workaround
  is not give untrusted users read access to the Node-RED editor.
