details: Bolt CMS before version 3.7.1 lacked CSRF protection in the preview generating
  endpoint. Previews are intended to be generated by the admins, developers, chief-editors,
  and editors, who are authorized to create content in the application. But due to
  lack of proper CSRF protection, unauthorized users could generate a preview. This
  has been fixed in Bolt 3.7.1
