details: In Bolt CMS before version 3.7.1, the filename of uploaded files was vulnerable
  to stored XSS. It is not possible to inject javascript code in the file name when
  creating/uploading the file. But, once created/uploaded, it can be renamed to inject
  the payload in it. Additionally, the measures to prevent renaming the file to disallowed
  filename extensions could be circumvented. This is fixed in Bolt 3.7.1.
