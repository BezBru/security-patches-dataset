details: DataDump is a MediaWiki extension that provides dumps of wikis. Prior to
  commit 67a82b76e186925330b89ace9c5fd893a300830b, DataDump had no protection against
  CSRF attacks so requests to generate or delete dumps could be forged. The vulnerability
  was patched in commit 67a82b76e186925330b89ace9c5fd893a300830b. There are no known
  workarounds. You must completely disable DataDump.
