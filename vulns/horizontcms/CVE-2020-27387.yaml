details: 'An unrestricted file upload issue in HorizontCMS through 1.0.0-beta allows
  an authenticated remote attacker (with access to the FileManager) to upload and
  execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a PHP payload, and then using the FileManager''s
  rename function to provide the payload (which will receive a random name on the
  server) with the PHP extension, and finally executing the PHP file via an HTTP GET
  request to /storage/<php_file_name>. NOTE: the vendor has patched this while leaving
  the version number at 1.0.0-beta.'
