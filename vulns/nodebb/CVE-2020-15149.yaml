details: 'NodeBB before version 1.14.3 has a bug introduced in version 1.12.2 in the
  validation logic that makes it possible to change the password of any user on a
  running NodeBB forum by sending a specially crafted socket.io call to the server.
  This could lead to a privilege escalation event due via an account takeover. As
  a workaround you may cherry-pick the following commit from the project''s repository
  to your running instance of NodeBB: 16cee1b03ba3eee177834a1fdac4aa8a12b39d2a. This
  is fixed in version 1.14.3.'
