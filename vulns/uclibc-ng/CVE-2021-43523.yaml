details: In uClibc and uClibc-ng before 1.0.39, incorrect handling of special characters
  in domain names returned by DNS servers via gethostbyname, getaddrinfo, gethostbyaddr,
  and getnameinfo can lead to output of wrong hostnames (leading to domain hijacking)
  or injection into applications (leading to remote code execution, XSS, applications
  crashes, etc.). In other words, a validation step, which is expected in any stub
  resolver, does not occur.
