details: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
  matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
  VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests
  to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service
  attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting
  the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts
  federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0.
  As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict
  the homeservers communicated with over federation.
