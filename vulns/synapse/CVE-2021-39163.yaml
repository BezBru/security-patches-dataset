details: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over
  IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar,
  topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability
  is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted
  users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver
  administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already
  access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only
  homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set
  to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher
  to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators
  can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this
  is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators
  that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality,
  block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.
