details: dropwizard-validation before versions 2.0.3 and 1.3.21 has a remote code
  execution vulnerability. A server-side template injection was identified in the
  self-validating feature enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions,
  leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. If you are using a self-validating
  bean an upgrade to Dropwizard 1.3.21/2.0.3 or later is strongly recommended. The
  changes introduced in Dropwizard 1.3.19 and 2.0.2 for CVE-2020-5245 unfortunately
  did not fix the underlying issue completely. The issue has been fixed in dropwizard-validation
  1.3.21 and 2.0.3 or later. We strongly recommend upgrading to one of these versions.
