details: An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1.
  CSV (aka Formula) injection exists in the export spreadsheets functionality. These
  spreadsheets are generated dynamically from unvalidated or unfiltered user input
  in the Name and Internal Notes fields in the Users tab, and the Issue Summary field
  in the tickets tab. This allows other agents to download data in a .csv file format
  or .xls file format. This is used as input for spreadsheet applications such as
  Excel and OpenOffice Calc, resulting in a situation where cells in the spreadsheets
  can contain input from an untrusted source. As a result, the end user who is accessing
  the exported spreadsheet can be affected.
