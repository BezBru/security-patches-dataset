details: An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1.
  The Ticket creation form allows users to upload files along with queries. It was
  found that the file-upload functionality has fewer (or no) mitigations implemented
  for file content checks; also, the output is not handled properly, causing persistent
  XSS that leads to cookie stealing or malicious actions. For example, a non-agent
  user can upload a .html file, and Content-Disposition will be set to inline instead
  of attachment.
