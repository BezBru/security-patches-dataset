details: squashfs_opendir in unsquash-2.c in Squashfs-Tools 4.5 allows Directory Traversal,
  a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-40153. A squashfs filesystem that has been
  crafted to include a symbolic link and then contents under the same filename in
  a filesystem can cause unsquashfs to first create the symbolic link pointing outside
  the expected directory, and then the subsequent write operation will cause the unsquashfs
  process to write through the symbolic link elsewhere in the filesystem.
