aliases: []
modified: 2013-10-28T15:14Z

details: The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not properly
  reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process
  to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive
  information by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and
  accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process.
