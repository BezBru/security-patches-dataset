details: Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1 enables a remember-me cookie based on a hash
  created from the username, password, and an additional system key. This means that
  an attacker getting access to a remember-me token for one server can get access
  to all servers which allow log-in using the same credentials without ever needing
  the credentials. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1
