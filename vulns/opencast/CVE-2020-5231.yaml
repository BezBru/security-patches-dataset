details: "In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, users with the role ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN can\
  \ use the user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the role ROLE_ADMIN.\
  \ ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN is a non-standard role in Opencast which is referenced neither\
  \ in the documentation nor in any code (except for tests) but only in the security\
  \ configuration. From the name \u2013 implying an admin for a specific course \u2013\
  \ users would never expect that this role allows user creation. This issue is fixed\
  \ in 7.6 and 8.1 which both ship a new default security configuration."
