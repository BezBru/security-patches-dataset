details: In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, using a remember-me cookie with an arbitrary
  username can cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if
  the remember-me cookie was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also allows
  anonymous access. This way, an attacker can, for example, fake a remember-me token,
  assume the identity of the global system administrator and request non-public content
  from the search service without ever providing any proper authentication. This problem
  is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1
