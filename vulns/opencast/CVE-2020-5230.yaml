details: "Opencast before 8.1 and 7.6 allows almost arbitrary identifiers for media\
  \ packages and elements to be used. This can be problematic for operation and security\
  \ since such identifiers are sometimes used for file system operations which may\
  \ lead to an attacker being able to escape working directories and write files to\
  \ other locations. In addition, Opencast's Id.toString(\u2026) vs Id.compact(\u2026\
  ) behavior, the latter trying to mitigate some of the file system problems, can\
  \ cause errors due to identifier mismatch since an identifier may unintentionally\
  \ change. This issue is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and 8.1."
