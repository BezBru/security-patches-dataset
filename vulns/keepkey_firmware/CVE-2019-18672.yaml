details: Insufficient checks in the finite state machine of the ShapeShift KeepKey
  hardware wallet before firmware 6.2.2 allow a partial reset of cryptographic secrets
  to known values via crafted messages. Notably, this breaks the security of U2F for

  can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers and the interface is reachable via
  WebUSB.
