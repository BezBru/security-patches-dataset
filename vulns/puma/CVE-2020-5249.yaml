details: In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.3 and 3.12.4, if an application using Puma allows
  untrusted input in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage return
  character to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers
  or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting.
  While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other
  attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2020-5247, which
  fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses. This has been fixed in
  4.3.3 and 3.12.4.
