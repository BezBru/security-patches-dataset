details: In Shrine before version 3.3.0, when using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin,
  it's possible for the attacker to use a timing attack to guess the signature of
  the derivation URL. The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated
  signature in constant time, using `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the
  `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater. A
  possible workaround is provided in the linked advisory.
