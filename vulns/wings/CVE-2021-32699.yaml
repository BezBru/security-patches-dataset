details: Wings is the control plane software for the open source Pterodactyl game
  management system. All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable
  to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined.
  A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts
  to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to
  stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is
  no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running
  customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers
  created.
