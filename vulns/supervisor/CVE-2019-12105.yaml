details: '** DISPUTED ** In Supervisor through 4.0.2, an unauthenticated user can
  read log files or restart a service. Note: The maintainer responded that the affected
  component, inet_http_server, is not enabled by default but if the user enables it
  and does not set a password, Supervisor logs a warning message. The maintainer indicated
