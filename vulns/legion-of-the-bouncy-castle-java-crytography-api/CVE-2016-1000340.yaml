details: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider versions 1.51 to 1.55, a carry propagation
  bug was introduced in the implementation of squaring for several raw math classes
  have been fixed (org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???). These classes are used by our
  custom elliptic curve implementations (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.**), so there
  was the possibility of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations for elliptic
  curve scalar multiplications. Such errors would have been detected with high probability
  by the output validation for our scalar multipliers.
