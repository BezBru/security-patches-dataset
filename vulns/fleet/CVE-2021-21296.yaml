details: Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.7.0 a
  malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes
  the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of service. This is possible only
  while a live query is currently ongoing. We believe the impact of this vulnerability
  to be low given the requirement that the actor has a valid node key. There is no
  information disclosure, privilege escalation, or code execution. The issue is fixed
  in Fleet 3.7.0.
