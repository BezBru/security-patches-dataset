details: jsx-slack is a package for building JSON objects for Slack block kit surfaces
  from JSX. The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1
  is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with
  including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters
  may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against
  ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has
  updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic
  backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple
  tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.
