details: jsx-slack is a library for building JSON objects for Slack Block Kit surfaces
  from JSX. In versions prior to 4.5.1 users are vulnerable to a regular expression
  denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack. If attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into
  `<blockquote>` tag, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume
  an excessive amount of computing resources. jsx-slack v4.5.1 has patched to a regex
  for escaping blockquote characters. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
