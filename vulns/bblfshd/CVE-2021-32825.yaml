details: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In
  bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a "zipslip"
  vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may
  enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated
  target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions
  as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive
  file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may
  be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read.
  For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.
