details: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. Between (and including) versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1, the reset
  password form reveals the email address of users just by giving their username.
  The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to
  manually modify the `resetpasswordinline.vm` to perform the changes made to mitigate
  the vulnerability.
