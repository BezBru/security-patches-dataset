details: ORY Fosite is a security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go.
  In Fosite from version 0.30.2 and before version 0.34.1, there is an issue in which
  an an attacker can override the registered redirect URL by performing an OAuth flow
  and requesting a redirect URL that is to the loopback adapter. Attackers can provide
  both custom URL query parameters to their loopback redirect URL, as well as actually
  overriding the host of the registered redirect URL. These attacks are only applicable
  in scenarios where the attacker has access over the loopback interface. This vulnerability
  has been patched in ORY Fosite v0.34.1.
