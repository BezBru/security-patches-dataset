details: In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go)
  before version 0.34.0, the `TokenRevocationHandler` ignores errors coming from the
  storage. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful revocation
  while the token is still valid. Whether an attacker can use this for her advantage
  depends on the ability to trigger errors in the store. This is fixed in version
  0.34.0
