details: It was found that rpm did not properly handle RPM installations when a destination
  path was a symbolic link to a directory, possibly changing ownership and permissions
  of an arbitrary directory, and RPM files being placed in an arbitrary destination.
  An attacker, with write access to a directory in which a subdirectory will be installed,
  could redirect that directory to an arbitrary location and gain root privilege.
