details: It was found that versions of rpm before 4.13.0.2 use temporary files with
  predictable names when installing an RPM. An attacker with ability to write in a
  directory where files will be installed could create symbolic links to an arbitrary
  location and modify content, and possibly permissions to arbitrary files, which
  could be used for denial of service or possibly privilege escalation.
