details: 'DBdeployer is a tool that deploys MySQL database servers easily. In DBdeployer
  before version 1.58.2, users unpacking a tarball may use a maliciously packaged
  tarball that contains symlinks to files external to the target. In such scenario,
  an attacker could induce dbdeployer to write into a system file, thus altering the
  computer defenses. For the attack to succeed, the following factors need to contribute:
  1) The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it was designed
  to run as unprivileged user. 2) The user has taken a tarball from a non secure source,
  without testing the checksum. When the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer,
  the checksum is compared before attempting to unpack. This has been fixed in version
  1.58.2.'
