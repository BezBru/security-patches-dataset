details: 'Automattic Mongoose through 5.7.4 allows attackers to bypass access control
  (in some applications) because any query object with a _bsontype attribute is ignored.
  For example, adding "_bsontype":"a" can sometimes interfere with a query filter.
  NOTE: this CVE is about Mongoose''s failure to work around this _bsontype special
  case that exists in older versions of the bson parser (aka the mongodb/js-bson project).'
