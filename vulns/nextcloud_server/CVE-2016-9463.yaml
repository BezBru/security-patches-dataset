details: 'Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.1.2,
  9.0.6, and 8.2.9 suffer from SMB User Authentication Bypass. Nextcloud/ownCloud
  include an optional and not by default enabled SMB authentication component that
  allows authenticating users against an SMB server. This backend is implemented in
  a way that tries to connect to a SMB server and if that succeeded consider the user
  logged-in. The backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have
  any kind of anonymous auth configured. This is the default on SMB servers nowadays
  and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an account without valid
  credentials. Note: The SMB backend is disabled by default and requires manual configuration
  in the Nextcloud/ownCloud config file. If you have not configured the SMB backend
  then you''re not affected by this vulnerability.'
