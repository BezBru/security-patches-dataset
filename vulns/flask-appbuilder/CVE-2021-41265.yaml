details: Flask-AppBuilder is a development framework built on top of Flask. Verions
  prior to 3.3.4 contain an improper authentication vulnerability in the REST API.
  The issue allows for a malicious actor with a carefully crafted request to successfully
  authenticate and gain access to existing protected REST API endpoints. This only
  affects non database authentication types and new REST API endpoints. Users should
  upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.3.4 to receive a patch.
