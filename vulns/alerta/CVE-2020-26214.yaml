details: In Alerta before version 8.1.0, users may be able to bypass LDAP authentication
  if they provide an empty password when Alerta server is configure to use LDAP as
  the authorization provider. Only deployments where LDAP servers are configured to
  allow unauthenticated authentication mechanism for anonymous authorization are affected.
  A fix has been implemented in version 8.1.0 that returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized response
  for any authentication attempts where the password field is empty. As a workaround
  LDAP administrators can disallow unauthenticated bind requests by clients.
