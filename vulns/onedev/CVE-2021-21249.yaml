details: OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3,
  there is an issue involving YAML parsing which can lead to post-auth remote code
  execution. In order to parse and process YAML files, OneDev uses SnakeYaml which
  by default (when not using `SafeConstructor`) allows the instantiation of arbitrary
  classes. We can leverage that to run arbitrary code by instantiating classes such
  as `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` and using `URLClassLoader` to load the script
  engine provider, resulting in the instantiation of a user controlled class. For
  a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by
  only allowing certain known classes to be deserialized
