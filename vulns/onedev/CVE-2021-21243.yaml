details: OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3,
  a Kubernetes REST endpoint exposes two methods that deserialize untrusted data from
  the request body. These endpoints do not enforce any authentication or authorization
  checks. This issue may lead to pre-auth RCE. This issue was fixed in 4.0.3 by not
  using deserialization at KubernetesResource side.
