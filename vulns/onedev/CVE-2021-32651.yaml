details: OneDev is a development operations platform. If the LDAP external authentication
  mechanism is enabled in OneDev versions 4.4.1 and prior, an attacker can manipulate
  a user search filter to send forged queries to the application and explore the LDAP
  tree using Blind LDAP Injection techniques. The specific payload depends on how
  the User Search Filter property is configured in OneDev. This issue was fixed in
  version 4.4.2.
