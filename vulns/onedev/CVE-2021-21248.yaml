details: OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3,
  there is a critical vulnerability involving the build endpoint parameters. InputSpec
  is used to define parameters of a Build spec. It does so by using dynamically generated
  Groovy classes. A user able to control job parameters can run arbitrary code on
  OneDev's server by injecting arbitrary Groovy code. The ultimate result is in the
  injection of a static constructor that will run arbitrary code. For a full example
  refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by escaping special
  characters such as quote from user input.
