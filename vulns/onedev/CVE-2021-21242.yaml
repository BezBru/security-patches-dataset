details: OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3,
  there is a critical vulnerability which can lead to pre-auth remote code execution.
  AttachmentUploadServlet deserializes untrusted data from the `Attachment-Support`
  header. This Servlet does not enforce any authentication or authorization checks.
  This issue may lead to pre-auth remote code execution. This issue was fixed in 4.0.3
  by removing AttachmentUploadServlet and not using deserialization
