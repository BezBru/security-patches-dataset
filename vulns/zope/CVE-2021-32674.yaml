details: 'Zope is an open-source web application server. This advisory extends the
  previous advisory at https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36
  with additional cases of TAL expression traversal vulnerabilities. Most Python modules
  are not available for using in TAL expressions that you can add through-the-web,
  for example in Zope Page Templates. This restriction avoids file system access,
  for example via the ''os'' module. But some of the untrusted modules are available
  indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct use. By default,
  you need to have the Manager role to add or edit Zope Page Templates through the
  web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates through
  the web are at risk. The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.2.1 and 4.6.1. The workaround
  is the same as for https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36:
  A site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the
  web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should
  not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through
  the web should be restricted to trusted users only.'
