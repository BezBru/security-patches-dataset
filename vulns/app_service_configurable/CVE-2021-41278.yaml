details: "Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for\
  \ developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the\
  \ EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk\
  \ \u201CAES\u201D transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers\
  \ to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an\
  \ \u201Caes\u201D transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data\
  \ in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not\
  \ enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the\
  \ user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry\
  \ Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201Caes\u201D\
  \ transform and provides an improved \u201Caes256\u201D transform in its place.\
  \ The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed\
  \ in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends\
  \ on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that\
  \ is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing\
  \ pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the\
  \ Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new \"aes256\"\
  \ transform."
