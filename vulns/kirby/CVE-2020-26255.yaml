details: 'Kirby is a CMS. In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.4.5, and Kirby
  Panel before version 2.5.14 , an editor with full access to the Kirby Panel can
  upload a PHP .phar file and execute it on the server. This vulnerability is critical
  if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users,
  as they can gain access to the server with such a Phar file. Visitors without Panel
  access *cannot* use this attack vector. The problem has been patched in Kirby 2.5.14
  and Kirby 3.4.5. Please update to one of these or a later version to fix the vulnerability.
  Note: Kirby 2 reaches end of life on December 31, 2020. We therefore recommend to
  upgrade your Kirby 2 sites to Kirby 3. If you cannot upgrade, we still recommend
  to update to Kirby 2.5.14.'
