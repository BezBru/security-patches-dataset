details: Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. Highlight.js
  versions before 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A malicious
  HTML code block can be crafted that will result in prototype pollution of the base
  object's prototype during highlighting. If you allow users to insert custom HTML
  code blocks into your page/app via parsing Markdown code blocks (or similar) and
  do not filter the language names the user can provide you may be vulnerable. The
  pollution should just be harmless data but this can cause problems for applications
  not expecting these properties to exist and can result in strange behavior or application
  crashes, i.e. a potential DOS vector. If your website or application does not render
  user provided data it should be unaffected. Versions 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 and newer
  include fixes for this vulnerability. If you are using version 7 or 8 you are encouraged
  to upgrade to a newer release.
