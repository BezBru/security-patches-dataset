details: A flaw was found in cairo's image-compositor.c in all versions prior to 1.17.4.
  This flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file to cairo's image-compositor
  (for example, by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo,
  or if an application uses cairo on untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow
  -> out-of-bounds WRITE. The highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
  integrity, as well as system availability.
