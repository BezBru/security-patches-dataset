details: Grassroot Platform is an application to make it faster, cheaper and easier
  to persistently organize and mobilize people in low-income communities. Grassroot
  Platform before master deployment as of 2021-04-16 did not properly verify the signature
  of JSON Web Tokens when refreshing an existing JWT. This allows to forge a valid
  JWT. The problem has been patched in version 1.3.1 by deprecating the JWT refresh
  function, which was an overdue deprecation regardless (the "refresh" flow is no
  longer used).
