details: Doorkeeper version 5.0.0 and later contains an information disclosure vulnerability
  that allows an attacker to retrieve the client secret only intended for the OAuth
  application owner. After authorizing the application and allowing access, the attacker
  simply needs to request the list of their authorized applications in a JSON format
  (usually GET /oauth/authorized_applications.json). An application is vulnerable
  if the authorized applications controller is enabled.
