details: in Scratch Login (MediaWiki extension) before version 1.1, any account can
  be logged into by using the same username with leading, trailing, or repeated underscore(s),
  since those are treated as whitespace and trimmed by MediaWiki. This affects all
  users on any wiki using this extension. Since version 1.1, comments by users whose
  usernames would be trimmed on MediaWiki are ignored when searching for the verification
  code.
