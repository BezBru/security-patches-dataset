details: mpv through 0.28.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
  a crafted web site, because it reads HTML documents containing VIDEO elements, and
  accepts arbitrary URLs in a src attribute without a protocol whitelist in player/lua/ytdl_hook.lua.
  For example, an av://lavfi:ladspa=file= URL signifies that the product should call
  dlopen on a shared object file located at an arbitrary local pathname. The issue
  exists because the product does not consider that youtube-dl can provide a potentially
  unsafe URL.
