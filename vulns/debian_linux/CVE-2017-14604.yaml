details: GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by using
  the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a .desktop file's
  Name field ends in .pdf but this file's Exec field launches a malicious "sh -c"
  command. In other words, Nautilus provides no UI indication that a file actually
  has the potentially unsafe .desktop extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf
  extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop
  file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that
  the file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the user's
  answer in the metadata::trusted field.
