details: The http.c:skip_short_body() function is called in some circumstances, such
  as when processing redirects. When the response is sent chunked in wget before 1.19.2,
  the chunk parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that
  the chunk length is a non-negative number. The code then tries to skip the chunk
  in pieces of 512 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing the negative
  chunk length to connect.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high
  32 bits of the chunk length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completely attacker
  controlled length argument.
