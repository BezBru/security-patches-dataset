details: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier ECDSA does not
  fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject
  extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate,
  which in some cases may allow the introduction of 'invisible' data into a signed
  structure.
