details: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected
  versions specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can cause the heap-based
  Lua stack to be overflowed, due to incomplete checks for this condition. This can
  result with heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. This problem
  exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6. The
  problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to update
  an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server
  executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using
  ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.
