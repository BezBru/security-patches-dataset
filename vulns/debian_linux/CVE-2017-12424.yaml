details: In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal
  data structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input may lead to crashes
  (with a buffer overflow or other memory corruption) or other unspecified behaviors.
  This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting environments
  in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts.
