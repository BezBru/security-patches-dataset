details: A flaw was found in libgit2 before version 0.27.3. It has been discovered
  that an unexpected sign extension in git_delta_apply function in delta.c file may
  lead to an integer overflow which in turn leads to an out of bound read, allowing
  to read before the base object. An attacker may use this flaw to leak memory addresses
  or cause a Denial of Service.
