details: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier DSA signature
  generation is vulnerable to timing attack. Where timings can be closely observed
  for the generation of signatures, the lack of blinding in 1.55, or earlier, may
  allow an attacker to gain information about the signature's k value and ultimately
  the private value as well.
