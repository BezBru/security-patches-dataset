details: yaws before 2.0.4 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace
  conflicts and therefore does not protect CGI applications from the presence of untrusted
  client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers
  to redirect a CGI application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server
  via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue.
