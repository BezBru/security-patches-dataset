details: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written
  in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN,
  TURN, and ICE. In PJSIP before version 2.11.1, there are a couple of issues found
  in the SSL socket. First, a race condition between callback and destroy, due to
  the accepted socket having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket parent/listener
  may get destroyed during handshake. Both issues were reported to happen intermittently
  in heavy load TLS connections. They cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service.
  These are fixed in version 2.11.1.
