details: shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux,
  and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid programs
  are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam
  but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM
  configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination
  leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel,
  usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges
  to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately
  December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins
  were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version
  4.8).
