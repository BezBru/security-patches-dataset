details: osquery before version 4.4.0 enables a privilege escalation vulnerability.
  If a Window system is configured with a PATH that contains a user-writable directory
  then a local user may write a zlib1.dll DLL, which osquery will attempt to load.
  Since osquery runs with elevated privileges this enables local escalation. This
  is fixed in version 4.4.0.
