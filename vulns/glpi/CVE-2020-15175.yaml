details: "In GLPI before version 9.5.2, the `?pluginimage.send.php?` endpoint allows\
  \ a user to specify an image from a plugin. The parameters can be maliciously crafted\
  \ to instead delete the .htaccess file for the files directory. Any user becomes\
  \ able to read all the files and folders contained in \u201C/files/\u201D. Some\
  \ of the sensitive information that is compromised are the user sessions, logs,\
  \ and more. An attacker would be able to get the Administrators session token and\
  \ use that to authenticate. The issue is patched in version 9.5.2."
