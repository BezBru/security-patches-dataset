details: 'GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides
  ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI before
  version 9.5.4 there is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) on "Solutions".
  This vulnerability gives an unauthorized user the ability to enumerate GLPI items
  names (including users logins) using the knowbase search form (requires authentication).
  To Reproduce: Perform a valid authentication at your GLPI instance, Browse the ticket
  list and select any open ticket, click on Solution form, then Search a solution
  form that will redirect you to the endpoint /"glpi/front/knowbaseitem.php?item_itemtype=Ticket&item_items_id=18&forcetab=Knowbase$1",
  and the item_itemtype=Ticket parameter present in the previous URL will point to
  the PHP alias of glpi_tickets table, so just replace it with "Users" to point to
  glpi_users table instead; in the same way, item_items_id=18 will point to the related
  column id, so changing it too you should be able to enumerate all the content which
  has an alias. Since such id(s) are obviously incremental, a malicious party could
  exploit the vulnerability simply by guessing-based attempts.'
