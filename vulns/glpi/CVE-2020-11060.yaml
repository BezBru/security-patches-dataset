details: In GLPI before 9.4.6, an attacker can execute system commands by abusing
  the backup functionality. Theoretically, this vulnerability can be exploited by
  an attacker without a valid account by using a CSRF. Due to the difficulty of the
  exploitation, the attack is only conceivable by an account having Maintenance privileges
  and the right to add WIFI networks. This is fixed in version 9.4.6.
