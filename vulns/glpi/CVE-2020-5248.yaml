details: GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default
  encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone
  can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key
  before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with
  the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are
  using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would
  lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.
