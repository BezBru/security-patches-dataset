details: In GLPI before version 9.5.0, the encryption algorithm used is insecure.
  The security of the data encrypted relies on the password used, if a user sets a
  weak/predictable password, an attacker could decrypt data. This is fixed in version
  9.5.0 by using a more secure encryption library. The library chosen is sodium.
