details: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. If an admin sets
  up Redash versions 10.0.0 and prior without explicitly specifying the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`
  or `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, a default value is used for both that
  is the same across all installations. In such cases, the instance is vulnerable
  to attackers being able to forge sessions using the known default value. This issue
  only affects installations where the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET or REDASH_SECRET_KEY`
  environment variables have not been explicitly set. This issue does not affect users
  of the official Redash cloud images, Redash's Digital Ocean marketplace droplets,
  or the scripts in the `getredash/setup` repository. These instances automatically
  generate unique secret keys during installation. One can verify whether one's instance
  is affected by checking the value of the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` environment variable.
  If it is `c292a0a3aa32397cdb050e233733900f`, should follow the steps to secure the
  instance, outlined in the GitHub Security Advisory.
