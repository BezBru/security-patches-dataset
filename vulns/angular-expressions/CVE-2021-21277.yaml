details: 'angular-expressions is "angular''s nicest part extracted as a standalone
  module for the browser and node". In angular-expressions before version 1.1.2 there
  is a vulnerability which allows Remote Code Execution if you call "expressions.compile(userControlledInput)"
  where "userControlledInput" is text that comes from user input. The security of
  the package could be bypassed by using a more complex payload, using a ".constructor.constructor"
  technique. In terms of impact: If running angular-expressions in the browser, an
  attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput).
  If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript
  expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution. This is fixed in version 1.1.2 of
  angular-expressions A temporary workaround might be either to disable user-controlled
  input that will be fed into angular-expressions in your application or allow only
  following characters in the userControlledInput.'
