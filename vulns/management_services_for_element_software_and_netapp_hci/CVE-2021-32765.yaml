details: Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In affected
  versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted
  or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like)
  replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented
  in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check,
  it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis
  who are unable to update may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements)
  context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.
