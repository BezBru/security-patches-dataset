details: Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. In affected
  versions A malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where
  Scaffolder Tasks are run. The attack is executed by crafting a custom Scaffolder
  template with a `github:publish:pull-request` action and a particular source path.
  When the template is executed the sensitive files would be included in the published
  pull request. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would
  need access to create and register templates in the Backstage catalog, and that
  the attack is very visible given that the exfiltration happens via a pull request.
  The vulnerability is patched in the `0.15.9` release of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.
