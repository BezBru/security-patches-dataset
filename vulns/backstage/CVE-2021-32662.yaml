details: Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals, and techdocs-common
  contains common functionalities for Backstage's TechDocs. In `@backstage/techdocs-common`
  versions prior to 0.6.3, a malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment
  where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path
  for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs
  backend API. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would
  need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would
  also need access to the TechDocs backend API. The vulnerability is patched in the
  `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.
