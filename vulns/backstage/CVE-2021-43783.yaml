details: '@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend is the backend for the default Backstage
  software templates. In affected versions a malicious actor with write access to
  a registered scaffolder template is able to manipulate the template in a way that
  writes files to arbitrary paths on the scaffolder-backend host instance. This vulnerability
  can in some situation also be exploited through user input when executing a template,
  meaning you do not need write access to the templates. This method will not allow
  the attacker to control the contents of the injected file however, unless the template
  is also crafted in a specific way that gives control of the file contents. This
  vulnerability is fixed in version `0.15.14` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.
  This attack is mitigated by restricting access and requiring reviews when registering
  or modifying scaffolder templates.'
