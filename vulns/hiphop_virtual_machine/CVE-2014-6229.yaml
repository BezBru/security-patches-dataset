details: The HashContext class in hphp/runtime/ext/ext_hash.cpp in Facebook HipHop
  Virtual Machine (HHVM) before 3.3.0 incorrectly expects that a certain key string
  uses '\0' for termination, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
  by leveraging read access beyond the end of the string, and makes it easier for
  remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging truncation
  of a string containing an internal '\0' character.
