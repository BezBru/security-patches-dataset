details: Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected
  versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in "Upload from URL"
  and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public
  information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However,
  if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround
  this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks
  from the host where the application is running.
