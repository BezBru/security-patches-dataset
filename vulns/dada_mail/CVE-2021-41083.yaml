details: Dada Mail is a web-based e-mail list management system. In affected versions
  a bad actor could give someone a carefully crafted web page via email, SMS, etc,
  that - when visited, allows them control of the list control panel as if the bad
  actor was logged in themselves. This includes changing any mailing list password,
  as well as the Dada Mail Root Password - which could effectively shut out actual
  list owners of the mailing list and allow the bad actor complete and unfettered
  control of your mailing list. This vulnerability also affects profile logins. For
  this vulnerability to work, the target of the bad actor would need to be logged
  into the list control panel themselves. This CSRF vulnerability in Dada Mail affects
  all versions of Dada Mail v11.15.1 and below. Although we know of no known CSRF
  exploits that have happened in the wild, this vulnerability has been confirmed by
  our testing, and by a third party. Users are advised to update to version 11.16.0.
