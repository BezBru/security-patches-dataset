details: pfSense versions 2.4.1 and lower are vulnerable to clickjacking attacks in
  the CSRF error page resulting in privileged execution of arbitrary code, because
  the error detection occurs before an X-Frame-Options header is set. This is fixed
  in 2.4.2-RELEASE. OPNsense, a 2015 fork of pfSense, was not vulnerable since version
  16.1.16 released on June 06, 2016. The unprotected web form was removed from the
  code during an internal security audit under "possibly insecure" suspicions.
