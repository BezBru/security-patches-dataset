details: An issue was discovered in includes/head.inc.php in rConfig before 3.9.4.
  An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve saved cleartext credentials via a GET request
  to settings.php. Because the application was not exiting after a redirect is applied,
  the rest of the page still executed, resulting in the disclosure of cleartext credentials
  in the response.
