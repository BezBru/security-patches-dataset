details: Python TUF (The Update Framework) reference implementation before version
  0.12 it will incorrectly trust a previously downloaded root metadata file which
  failed verification at download time. This allows an attacker who is able to serve
  multiple new versions of root metadata (i.e. by a person-in-the-middle attack) culminating
  in a version which has not been correctly signed to control the trust chain for
  future updates. This is fixed in version 0.12 and newer.
