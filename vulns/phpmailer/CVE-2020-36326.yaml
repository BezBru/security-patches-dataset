details: 'PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through Phar Deserialization
  via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296,
  but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were
  always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended
  side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.'
