details: Cubecart 6.4.2 allows Session Fixation. The application does not generate
  a new session cookie after the user is logged in. A malicious user is able to create
  a new session cookie value and inject it to a victim. After the victim logs in,
  the injected cookie becomes valid, giving the attacker access to the user's account
  through the active session.
