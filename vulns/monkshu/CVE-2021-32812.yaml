details: Monkshu is an enterprise application server for mobile apps (iOS and Android),
  responsive HTML 5 apps, and JSON API services. In version 2.90 and earlier, there
  is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in frontend HTTP server. The attacker
  can send in a carefully crafted URL along with a known bug in the server which will
  cause a 500 error, and the response will then embed the URL provided by the hacker.
  The impact is moderate as the hacker must also be able to craft an HTTP request
  which should cause a 500 server error. None such requests are known as this point.
  The issue is patched in version 2.95. As a workaround, one may use a disk caching
  plugin.
