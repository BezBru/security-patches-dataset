details: ibm_db is an asynchronous/synchronous interface for node.js to IBM DB2 and
  IBM Informix. ibm_db before 1.0.2 downloads binary resources over HTTP, which leaves
  it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution
  (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker controlled binary if
  the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote
  server.
