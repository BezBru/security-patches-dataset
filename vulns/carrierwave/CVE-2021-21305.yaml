details: CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible
  way to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2
  and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The "#manipulate!" method inappropriately
  evals the content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft
  a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies
  untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This
  is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.
