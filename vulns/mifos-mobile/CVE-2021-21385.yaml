details: Mifos-Mobile Android Application for MifosX is an Android Application built
  on top of the MifosX Self-Service platform. Mifos-Mobile before commit e505f62 disables
  HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP client. Additionally it accepted any self-signed
  certificate as valid. Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS
  to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can
  allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. Accepting any certificate, even self-signed
  ones allows man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is fixed in mifos-mobile commit
  e505f62.
