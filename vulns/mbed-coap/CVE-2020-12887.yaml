details: Memory leaks were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3 when
  using the Arm mbed-coap library 5.1.5. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing
  received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP
  option number field of all options present in the input packet. Each option number
  is calculated as a sum of the previous option number and a delta of the current
  option. The delta and the previous option number are expressed as unsigned 16-bit
  integers. Due to lack of overflow detection, it is possible to craft a packet that
  wraps the option number around and results in the same option number being processed
  again in a single packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation
  function. In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY, COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH, COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY,
  and COAP_OPTION_ETAG, there is no check on whether memory has already been allocated,
  which in conjunction with the option number integer overflow may lead to multiple
  assignments of allocated memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated
  to lead to memory leak by buffer orphaning. As a result, the memory is never freed.
