details: In nDPI through 3.2 Stable, the SSH protocol dissector has multiple KEXINIT
  integer overflows that result in a controlled remote heap overflow in concat_hash_string
  in ssh.c. Due to the granular nature of the overflow primitive and the ability to
  control both the contents and layout of the nDPI library's heap memory through remote
  input, this vulnerability may be abused to achieve full Remote Code Execution against
  any network inspection stack that is linked against nDPI and uses it to perform
  network traffic analysis.
