details: TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access control
  when requesting users.queries.php. It is then possible for a manager user to delete
  an arbitrary user (including admin), or modify attributes of any arbitrary user
  except administrator. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must
  have the manager rights on the application, then tamper with the requests sent directly,
  for example by changing the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_user" on users.queries.php.
