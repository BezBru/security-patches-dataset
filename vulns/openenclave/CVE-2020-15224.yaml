details: In Open Enclave before version 0.12.0, an information disclosure vulnerability
  exists when an enclave application using the syscalls provided by the sockets.edl
  is loaded by a malicious host application. An attacker who successfully exploited
  the vulnerability could read privileged data from the enclave heap across trust
  boundaries. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an
  affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would
  not allow an attacker to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain
  information otherwise considered confidential in an enclave, which could be used
  in further compromises. The issue has been addressed in version 0.12.0 and the current
  master branch. Users will need to to recompile their applications against the patched
  libraries to be protected from this vulnerability.
