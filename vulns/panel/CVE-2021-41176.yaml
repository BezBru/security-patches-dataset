details: Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP
  7, React, and Go. In affected versions of Pterodactyl a malicious user can trigger
  a user logout if a signed in user visits a malicious website that makes a request
  to the Panel's sign-out endpoint. This requires a targeted attack against a specific
  Panel instance, and serves only to sign a user out. **No user details are leaked,
  nor is any user data affected, this is simply an annoyance at worst.** This is fixed
  in version 1.6.3.
