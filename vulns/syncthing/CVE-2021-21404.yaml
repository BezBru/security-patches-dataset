details: Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before
  version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by
  sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself
  can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay
  server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from
  a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing,
  at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed
  in version 1.15.0.
