details: BrowserUp Proxy allows you to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, capture
  HTTP content, and export performance data as a HAR file. BrowserUp Proxy works well
  as a standalone proxy server, but it is especially useful when embedded in Selenium
  tests. A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in BrowserUp Proxy enabling
  attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote
  Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. This has been patched in version 2.1.2.
