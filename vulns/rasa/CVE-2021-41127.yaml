details: Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based
  conversations. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in the functionality
  that loads a trained model `tar.gz` file which allows a malicious actor to craft
  a `model.tar.gz` file which can overwrite or replace bot files in the bot directory.
  The vulnerability is fixed in Rasa 2.8.10. For users unable to update ensure that
  users do not upload untrusted model files, and restrict CLI or API endpoint access
  where a malicious actor could target a deployed Rasa instance.
