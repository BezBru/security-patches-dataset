details: Armeria is an open source microservice framework. In affected versions an
  attacker can access an Armeria server's local file system beyond its restricted
  directory by sending an HTTP request whose path contains `%2F` (encoded `/`), such
  as `/files/..%2Fsecrets.txt`, bypassing Armeria's path validation logic. Armeria
  1.13.4 or above contains the hardened path validation logic that handles `%2F` properly.
  This vulnerability can be worked around by inserting a decorator that performs an
  additional validation on the request path.
