details: eLabFTW is an open source electronic lab notebook manager for research teams.
  In versions of eLabFTW before 4.1.0, it allows attackers to bypass a brute-force
  protection mechanism by using many different forged PHPSESSID values in HTTP Cookie
  header. This issue has been addressed by implementing brute force login protection,
  as recommended by Owasp with Device Cookies. This mechanism will not impact users
  and will effectively thwart any brute-force attempts at guessing passwords. The
  only correct way to address this is to upgrade to version 4.1.0. Adding rate limitation
  upstream of the eLabFTW service is of course a valid option, with or without upgrading.
