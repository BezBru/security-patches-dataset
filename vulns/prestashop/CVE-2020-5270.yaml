details: In PrestaShop between versions 1.7.6.0 and 1.7.6.5, there is an open redirection
  when using back parameter. The impacts can be many, and vary from the theft of information
  and credentials to the redirection to malicious websites containing attacker-controlled
  content, which in some cases even cause XSS attacks. So even though an open redirection
  might sound harmless at first, the impacts of it can be severe should it be exploitable.
  The problem is fixed in 1.7.6.5
