details: In PrestaShop before version 1.7.6.4, when a customer edits their address,
  they can freely change the id_address in the form, and thus steal someone else's
  address. It is the same with CustomerForm, you are able to change the id_customer
  and change all information of all accounts. The problem is patched in version 1.7.6.4.
