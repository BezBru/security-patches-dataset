details: In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injection vulnerability
  is present in versions before 3.8.0, 5.1.0, and 6.2.0. If user-supplied input was
  passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a semicolon could
  be injected leading to directive injection. This could be used to e.g. override
  a script-src directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and the first one wins.
  The directives in secure_headers are sorted alphabetically so they pretty much all
  come before script-src. A previously undefined directive would receive a value even
  if SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT was supplied. The fixed versions will silently convert
  the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning when this happens. This
  will result in innocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally
  used. In future releases, we will raise application errors resulting in 500s. Depending
  on what major version you are using, the fixed versions are 6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0.
