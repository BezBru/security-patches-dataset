details: '** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** An issue was discovered in ReadyTalk Avian
  1.2.0 before 2020-10-27. The FileOutputStream.write() method in FileOutputStream.java
  has a boundary check to prevent out-of-bounds memory read/write operations. However,
  an integer overflow leads to bypassing this check and achieving the out-of-bounds
  access. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported
  by the maintainer.'
