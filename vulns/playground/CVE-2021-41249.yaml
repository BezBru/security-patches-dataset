details: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications.
  All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28
  are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop
  values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface
  that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack
  to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There
  are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious
  schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL
  Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript
  can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials
  or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your
  client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.
