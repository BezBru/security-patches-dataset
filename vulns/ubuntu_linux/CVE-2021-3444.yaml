details: 'The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mod32 destination
  register truncation when the source register was known to be 0. A local attacker
  with the ability to load bpf programs could use this gain out-of-bounds reads in
  kernel memory leading to information disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds
  writes that could potentially lead to code execution. This issue was addressed in
  the upstream kernel in commit 9b00f1b78809 ("bpf: Fix truncation handling for mod32
  dst reg wrt zero") and in Linux stable kernels 5.11.2, 5.10.19, and 5.4.101.'
