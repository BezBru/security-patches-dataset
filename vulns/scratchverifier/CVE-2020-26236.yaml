details: 'In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification
  process to log into someone else''s account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier
  for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login
  process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification
  code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker
  completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed
  login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting
  a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and
  attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not
  hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as
  soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker
  to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code,
  so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take
  several seconds before finishing the login.'
