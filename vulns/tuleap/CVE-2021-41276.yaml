details: Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application
  and system developments. In affected versions Tuleap does not sanitize properly
  the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization.
  A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account
  by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either
  need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP
  operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs
  to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable.
  This issue has been patched in Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.31, Tuleap Enterprise
  Edition 13.1-5, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-3.
