details: 'Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application
  and system developments. This is a follow up to GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm/CVE-2021-41276,
  the initial fix was incomplete. Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter
  built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious
  user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing
  the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to
  have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator
  with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have
  the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. The following
  versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise
  Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4.'
