  computer is shared with other users, a local attacker may be able to exploit the
  following scenarios. 1. A local regular user may modify the existing `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin\composer.bat`
  in order to get elevated command execution when composer is run by an administrator.
  2. A local regular user may create a specially crafted dll in the `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin`
  folder in order to get Local System privileges. See: https://itm4n.github.io/windows-server-netman-dll-hijacking.
  3. If the directory of the php.exe selected by the user is not in the system path,
  it is added without checking that it is admin secured, as per Microsoft guidelines.
