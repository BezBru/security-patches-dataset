details: fastify-http-proxy is an npm package which is a fastify plugin for proxying
  your http requests to another server, with hooks. By crafting a specific URL, it
  is possible to escape the prefix of the proxied backend service. If the base url
  of the proxied server is `/pub/`, a user expect that accessing `/priv` on the target
  service would not be possible. In affected versions, it is possible. This is fixed
  in version 4.3.1.
