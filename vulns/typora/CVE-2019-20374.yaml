details: A mutation cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Typora through 0.9.9.31.2
  on macOS and through 0.9.81 on Linux leads to Remote Code Execution through Mermaid
  code blocks. To exploit this vulnerability, one must open a file in Typora. The
  XSS vulnerability is then triggered due to improper HTML sanitization. Given that
  the application is based on the Electron framework, the XSS leads to remote code
  execution in an unsandboxed environment.
