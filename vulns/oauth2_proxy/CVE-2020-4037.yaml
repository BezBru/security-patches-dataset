details: In OAuth2 Proxy from version 5.1.1 and less than version 6.0.0, users can
  provide a redirect address for the proxy to send the authenticated user to at the
  end of the authentication flow. This is expected to be the original URL that the
  user was trying to access. This redirect URL is checked within the proxy and validated
  before redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing redirects to potentially
  harmful sites. This has been fixed in version 6.0.0.
