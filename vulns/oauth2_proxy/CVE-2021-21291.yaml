details: OAuth2 Proxy is an open-source reverse proxy and static file server that
  provides authentication using Providers (Google, GitHub, and others) to validate
  accounts by email, domain or group. In OAuth2 Proxy before version 7.0.0, for users
  that use the whitelist domain feature, a domain that ended in a similar way to the
  intended domain could have been allowed as a redirect. For example, if a whitelist
  domain was configured for ".example.com", the intention is that subdomains of example.com
  are allowed. Instead, "example.com" and "badexample.com" could also match. This
  is fixed in version 7.0.0 onwards. As a workaround, one can disable the whitelist
  domain feature and run separate OAuth2 Proxy instances for each subdomain.
