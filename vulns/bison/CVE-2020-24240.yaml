details: 'GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c
  (called from gram_lex) when a ''\0'' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk
  only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause
  unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended
  to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code
  that is generated by Bison.'
