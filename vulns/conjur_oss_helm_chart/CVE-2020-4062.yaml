details: 'In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability
  resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port.
  This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres
  database, including escalating the attacker''s privileges to assume full control.
  A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database
  and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read
  & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy
  that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install
  Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur
  OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker
  and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this
  vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions.
  If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate
  some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes
  cluster or namespace. The term "isolated" refers to: - No other workloads besides
  Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace.
  - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators
  via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).'
