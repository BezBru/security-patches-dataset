details: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache
  2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating
  users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In versions prior to 2.4.9, `oidc_validate_redirect_url()`
  does not parse URLs the same way as most browsers do. As a result, this function
  can be bypassed and leads to an Open Redirect vulnerability in the logout functionality.
  This bug has been fixed in version 2.4.9 by replacing any backslash of the URL to
  redirect with slashes to address a particular breaking change between the different
  specifications (RFC2396 / RFC3986 and WHATWG). As a workaround, this vulnerability
  can be mitigated by configuring `mod_auth_openidc` to only allow redirection whose
  destination matches a given regular expression.
