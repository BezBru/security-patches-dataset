details: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache
  2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating
  users against an OpenID Connect Provider. When mod_auth_openidc versions prior to
  2.4.9 are configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`,
  `OIDCSessionType server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly
  performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, which
  would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug. Initial assessment
  shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but
  can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers.
  This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation
  only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated
  by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed
  before use when this option is enabled.
