details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of the `SVDF` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero
  error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/7f283ff806b2031f407db64c4d3edcda8fb9f9f5/tensorflow/lite/kernels/svdf.cc#L99-L102).
  An attacker can craft a model such that `params->rank` would be 0. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
