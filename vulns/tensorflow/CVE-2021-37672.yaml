details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions an attacker can read from outside of bounds of heap allocated
  data by sending specially crafted illegal arguments to `tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizerV2`.
  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/sdca_internal.cc#L320-L353)
  does not check that the length of `example_labels` is the same as the number of
  examples. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a4e138660270e7599793fa438cd7b2fc2ce215a6.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
