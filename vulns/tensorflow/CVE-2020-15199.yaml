details: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` does not
  validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there
  is no validation that the `splits` tensor has the minimum required number of elements.
  Code uses this quantity to initialize a different data structure. Since `BatchedMap`
  is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to not be `nullptr`.
  If user passes a `splits` tensor that is empty or has exactly one element, we get
  a `SIGABRT` signal raised by the operating system. The issue is patched in commit
  3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.
