details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions an attacker can read from outside of bounds of heap allocated
  data by sending specially crafted illegal arguments to `tf.raw_ops.UpperBound`.
  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/searchsorted_op.cc#L85-L104)
  does not validate the rank of `sorted_input` argument. A similar issue occurs in
  `tf.raw_ops.LowerBound`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 42459e4273c2e47a3232cc16c4f4fff3b3a35c38.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
