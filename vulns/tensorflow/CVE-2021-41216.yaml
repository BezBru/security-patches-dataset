details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the shape inference function for `Transpose` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow.
  This occurs whenever `perm` contains negative elements. The shape inference function
  does not validate that the indices in `perm` are all valid. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow
  2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
