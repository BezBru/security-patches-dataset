details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  `Prepare` step of the `SpaceToDepth` TFLite operator does not check for 0 before
  division(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc/tensorflow/lite/kernels/space_to_depth.cc#L63-L67).
  An attacker can craft a model such that `params->block_size` would be zero. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
