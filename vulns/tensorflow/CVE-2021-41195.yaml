details: 'TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of `tf.math.segment_*` operations results in a `CHECK`-fail
  related abort (and denial of service) if a segment id in `segment_ids` is large.
  This is similar to CVE-2021-29584 (and similar other reported vulnerabilities in
  TensorFlow, localized to specific APIs): the implementation (both on CPU and GPU)
  computes the output shape using `AddDim`. However, if the number of elements in
  the tensor overflows an `int64_t` value, `AddDim` results in a `CHECK` failure which
  provokes a `std::abort`. Instead, code should use `AddDimWithStatus`. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.'
