details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Passing
  invalid arguments (e.g., discovered via fuzzing) to `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput`
  results in segfault. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and
  TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
