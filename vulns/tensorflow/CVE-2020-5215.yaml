details: In TensorFlow before 1.15.2 and 2.0.1, converting a string (from Python)
  to a tf.float16 value results in a segmentation fault in eager mode as the format
  checks for this use case are only in the graph mode. This issue can lead to denial
  of service in inference/training where a malicious attacker can send a data point
  which contains a string instead of a tf.float16 value. Similar effects can be obtained
  by manipulating saved models and checkpoints whereby replacing a scalar tf.float16
  value with a scalar string will trigger this issue due to automatic conversions.
  This can be easily reproduced by tf.constant("hello", tf.float16), if eager execution
  is enabled. This issue is patched in TensorFlow 1.15.1 and 2.0.1 with this vulnerability
  patched. TensorFlow 2.1.0 was released after we fixed the issue, thus it is not
  affected. Users are encouraged to switch to TensorFlow 1.15.1, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0.
