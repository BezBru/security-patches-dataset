details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the implementation of `SparseFillEmptyRows` can be made to trigger a heap OOB access.
  This occurs whenever the size of `indices` does not match the size of `values`.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
