details: In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases a saved model can
  trigger use of uninitialized values during code execution. This is caused by having
  tensor buffers be filled with the default value of the type but forgetting to default
  initialize the quantized floating point types in Eigen. This is fixed in versions
  1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.
