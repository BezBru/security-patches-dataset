details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the shape inference code for `tf.ragged.cross` can trigger a read outside of bounds
  of heap allocated array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
