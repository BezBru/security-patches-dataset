details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the code behind `tf.function` API can be made to deadlock when two `tf.function`
  decorated Python functions are mutually recursive. This occurs due to using a non-reentrant
  `Lock` Python object. Loading any model which contains mutually recursive functions
  is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service by causing users to load
  such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although this is not a frequent
  scenario. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
