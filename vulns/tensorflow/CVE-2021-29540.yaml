details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow to occur in `Conv2DBackpropFilter`. This
  is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1b0296c3b8dd9bd948f924aa8cd62f87dbb7c3da/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_filter_ops.cc#L495-L497)
  computes the size of the filter tensor but does not validate that it matches the
  number of elements in `filter_sizes`. Later, when reading/writing to this buffer,
  code uses the value computed here, instead of the number of elements in the tensor.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as
  these are also affected and still in supported range.
