details: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation
  does not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular,
  there is no validation that the `indices` tensor has the same shape as the `values`
  one. The values in these tensors are always accessed in parallel. Thus, a shape
  mismatch can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated buffers. The
  issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released
  in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.
