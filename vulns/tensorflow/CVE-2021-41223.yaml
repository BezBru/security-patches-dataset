details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the implementation of `FusedBatchNorm` kernels is vulnerable to a heap OOB access.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
