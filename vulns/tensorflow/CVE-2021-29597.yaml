details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of the `SpaceToBatchNd` TFLite operator is [vulnerable to a division
  by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/412c7d9bb8f8a762c5b266c9e73bfa165f29aac8/tensorflow/lite/kernels/space_to_batch_nd.cc#L82-L83).
  An attacker can craft a model such that one dimension of the `block` input is 0.
  Hence, the corresponding value in `block_shape` is 0. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow
  2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
