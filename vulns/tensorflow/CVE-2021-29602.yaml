details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of the `DepthwiseConv` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division
  by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1a8e885b864c818198a5b2c0cbbeca5a1e833bc8/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depthwise_conv.cc#L287-L288).
  An attacker can craft a model such that `input`'s fourth dimension would be 0. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
