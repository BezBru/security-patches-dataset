details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit`. This is because
  the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/699bff5d961f0abfde8fa3f876e6d241681fbef8/tensorflow/core/util/sparse/sparse_tensor.h#L528-L530)
  accesses an array element based on a user controlled offset. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow
  2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
