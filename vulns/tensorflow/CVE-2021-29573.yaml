details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` is vulnerable to a division
  by 0. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/279bab6efa22752a2827621b7edb56a730233bd8/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc#L1033-L1034)
  fails to validate that the batch dimension of the tensor is non-zero, before dividing
  by this quantity. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
