details: In Wiki.js before 2.3.81, there is a stored XSS in the Markdown editor. An
  editor with write access to a page, using the Markdown editor, could inject an XSS
  payload into the content. If another editor (with write access as well) load the
  same page into the Markdown editor, the XSS payload will be executed as part of
  the preview panel. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as it is
  stripped by the HTML Sanitization security module. This vulnerability only impacts
  editors loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. This has been patched
  in 2.3.81.
