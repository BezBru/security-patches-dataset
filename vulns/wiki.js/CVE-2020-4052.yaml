details: In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through
  template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism
  intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces.
  By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site
  scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when
  the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107.
