details: "Metabase is an open source data analytics platform. In affected versions\
  \ a security issue has been discovered with the custom GeoJSON map (`admin->settings->maps->custom\
  \ maps->add a map`) support and potential local file inclusion (including environment\
  \ variables). URLs were not validated prior to being loaded. This issue is fixed\
  \ in a new maintenance release (0.40.5 and 1.40.5), and any subsequent release after\
  \ that. If you\xE2\u20AC\u2122re unable to upgrade immediately, you can mitigate\
  \ this by including rules in your reverse proxy or load balancer or WAF to provide\
  \ a validation filter before the application."
