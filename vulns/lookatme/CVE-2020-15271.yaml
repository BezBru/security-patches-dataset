details: In lookatme (python/pypi package) versions prior to 2.3.0, the package automatically
  loaded the built-in "terminal" and "file_loader" extensions. Users that use lookatme
  to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run
  on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py`
  and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally,
  it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.
