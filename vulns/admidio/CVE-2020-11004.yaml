details: SQL Injection was discovered in Admidio before version 3.3.13. The main cookie
  parameter is concatenated into a SQL query without any input validation/sanitization,
  thus an attacker without logging in, can send a GET request with arbitrary SQL queries
  appended to the cookie parameter and execute SQL queries. The vulnerability impacts
  the confidentiality of the system. This has been patched in version 3.3.13.
