# CVE Details Tools

ðŸ”— Scraper for https://www.cvedetails.com/ data.

All the resulting datasets are available at `../../data/cve-details/` (in case you want to check it). There is also a jupyter notebook available in this folder that you can use to explore the datasets.

### 1. Getting the raw data

The **raw dataset** is not available throught the repository. There are two ways of getting the dataset:

1. Scrape the entire CVE Details by running the following script:

```bash
source scrape_data.sh
```

This script will save the data by `year` in `../../data/cve-details/year/`.

2. Download our google cloud mirror by running the following command:
   
```bash
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc\?id\=1qGrndhvMBbY15t9VUK7XTyb1UIhHu3mY
```

If you want to explore the raw data, there is a jupyter notebook available with some data analysis already. If you want to use it run the following command in this folder:
```jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

### 2. Scrape CVE Details by year

```python
python scraper.py --mode=year --year=2022 --folder=../../data/cve-details/year/
```

To scrape the entire website check section 1.

### 3. Generate Dataset

Generate the dataset with references to commits in source code hosting websites such as `github`, `bitbucket`, `gitlab` and `git`.

1. Merge, plot stats and normalize CVE Details data:
